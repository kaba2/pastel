This section summarizes the release history of Pastel.

### Versioning

The versioning of Pastel is given in the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z 
are integers. The x increments only for major changes, the y increments 
for feature changes, and the z increments for bug fixes or documentation 
updates. Whenever y is incremented, z is zeroed, and whenever x is 
incremented, both y and z are zeroed. The x, y, and z need not consist 
of a single digit, and, for example, 1.12.0 is a much later version 
than 1.1.3.

### Previous versions

It is possible to visit the webpages of a 
previous version by visiting the address

	http://kaba.hilvi.org/pastel/pastel-x.y.z
	
where x.y.z is a version number. That webpage then works as
it did on the time release, and can be used to obtain the
older software.

Pastel 1.2.0
------------

Release data 11.3.2011

#### PastelMatlab

 * A new library to aid in interfacing Pastel with Matlab.
 
#### PastelGeometryMatlab

 * A new library to offer a Matlab interface to a subset
 of PastelGeometry.
 
#### PastelGeometry

 * Added an ''O(n log(n))'' box maximum clique algorithm.
 * Added a set-difference algorithm for boxes.
 * Added a way to define the openness of shapes.
 * Turned nearest neighbor searching on kd-trees into a generic 
 implementation on which variants can be implemented as customizations.
 * Removed the support for bucket nodes from PointKdTree because of no gain.
 * Nearest neighbor searching on PointKdTree: removed hint-distances and
 bottom-up searching because of negligible gain.
 * Implemented range searching and range counting algorithms on PointKdTree.
 * Improved the brute-force nearest neighbors searching implementation.
 * Changed to use open search regions in nearest-neighbors and range
 searching.
 * Lifted PointPolicy_PointKdTree concept to a global PointPolicy concept.

#### PastelDsp

 * Added the computation of the discrete cosine transform, the discrete 
 fourier transform, the discrete Haar transform, and the discrete Hadamard 
 transform.
 * Added the algorithm object concept.

#### PastelSys

 * Added an augmented red-black tree.
 * Generalized vector expressions to mix between dynamic and compile-time
 dimensions.
 * Added a way to specify different actions on invariant failures. 
 * Added finalization for loggers, to give them an opportunity to flush
 buffered output before aborting a program.
 * Added a progress reporter class.
 * Added goodness-of-fit tests for random variables.
 * Added a way to specify storage ordering in Array. 

#### Build system

 * Changed to use the Premake build system, which generates
 the environment-specific build files.
 * The code now compiles on Windows, Linux, and Mac, on
 both Visual Studio and gcc, and in 32-bit and 64-bit modes.
 
### Others

 * A lot of refactoring, bug fixes, and updates to documentation.
 * Documentation built on Remark 1.3.

Pastel 1.1.0
------------

Release date 13.3.2010.

#### PastelGeometry

 * Added best-first algorithm to nearest neighbors searching
 and made it the default.
 * Added hint-distances to nearest neighbors searching to
 make it possible to make use of temporal coherence.
 * Added median-of-longest-side splitting rule for PointKdTree.

#### PastelSys

 * Fixed a bug with nextSmaller and nextGreater function.
 * Added isNan.

#### PastelGfxUi

 * A new library to offer a simple graphical gui.

Pastel 1.0.1
------------

Release date 13.1.2010.
