This section summarizes the release history of Pastel.

Conventions

### Versioning

The versioning of Pastel is given in the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z are integers. The x increments only for major changes, the y increments for feature changes, and the z increments for bug fixes or documentation updates. Whenever y is incremented, z is zeroed, and whenever x is incremented, both y and z are zeroed. The x, y, and z need not consist of a single digit, and, for example, 1.12.0 is a much later version than 1.1.3.
