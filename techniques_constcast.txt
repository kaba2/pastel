Casting away constness of an iterator
=====================================

[[Parent]]: techniques.txt

This technique is summarized as follows: when creating a data
structure, always provide a way to convert a const iterator to
a mutable iterator via a mutable reference to the data structure.

Demonstration
-------------

A slightly annoying shortcoming of the Standard Template Library, 
even in C++11, is that its containers do not directly allow to cast 
away the constness of their const iterators. Consider the following 
code.

[[CppCode]]:
	#include <list>

	typedef std::list<int> NumberSet;
	typedef NumberSet::iterator Number_Iterator;
	typedef NumberSet::const_iterator Number_ConstIterator;

	Number_ConstIterator find(
		Number_ConstIterator begin,
		Number_ConstIterator end)
	{
		Number_ConstIterator result = begin;
		// Find the proper number to 'result'...
		return result;
	}

	int main()
	{
		NumberSet numberSet;
		numberSet.push_back(1);
	
		// Let us assume that the number we are 
		// searching for exists.
		Number_ConstIterator number = 
			find(numberSet.cbegin(), numberSet.cend());

		// Problem: How to modify the found number?
		
		// Does not compile, since 'number' is a const iterator.
		// *number = 2;

		// We need to obtain a mutable iterator
		// instead to 'number'. But how?
		Number_Iterator mutableNumber;
		
		// Ideally, we would have something like this. 
		// Unfortunately, there is no such functionality in the STL.
		// mutableNumber = numberSet.cast(number);

		// Fortunately we can hack the effect for the
		// STL containers.
		mutableNumber = 
			numberSet.erase(number, number);

		// Ok.
		*mutableNumber = 2;

		return 0;
	}

The code above demonstrates that it is perfectly normal to end up
holding a const iterator, where a mutable iterator would be required
instead. If the original container is not available, then this would
simply be proper protection by constness. However, if the original
container _is_ available, then you have unlimited access to the
container in any case, and therefore should be able to convert
a const iterator to a mutable iterator. This functionality _has_ to
be provided by the container, or else we find ourselves in a dead end.
It is a very fortunate coincidence that the iterator const-cast can
be simulated by the empty erase call. Strictly speaking, however,
the cast function should be part of the container requirements, to
clearly document intent.

Concerning the example code, the hack to convert the const iterator 
to an iterator does not work in C++03. This is because of an oversight 
in the STL, where erase function in containers was required to take a 
mutable iterator as a parameter. This oversight was fixed in C++11.

Uses in Pastel
--------------

In Pastel, all data structures which provide mutable iterators
also provide cast functions to convert a const iterator to a
mutable iterator. These are given by the `cast()´ member functions.
