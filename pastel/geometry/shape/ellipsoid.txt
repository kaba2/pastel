An _ellipsoid_ is an affine transform of a sphere.

Theory
------

Alternatively, a subset ''Q sub RR^n'' is called an ellipsoid if there
exists ''c in RR^n'', and ''S in RR^{n xx n}'' symmetric positive-semi-definite, 
such that

	Q = {x in RR^n : (x - c)^T S (x - c) <= 1}.

The ''c'' is called the _center_ of the ellipsoid, and the ''S'' 
is called the _quadratic form matrix_ of the ellipsoid. This is a closed
ellipsoid; an open ellipsoid is defined with the condition ''< 1''.
