An _axis-aligned box_ ''S'' in ''RR^n'' is a Cartesian product of 
''n'' intervals. 

Theory
------

An axis-aligned box can be described by two points 
''A'' and ''B'' in ''RR^n'', such that 

	S = {x in RR^n | \forall i in [1, n] : A_i <= x_i < B_i}.

In this representation, ''A'' is called the _minimum point_, and 
''B'' is called the _maximum point_. Here we have used half-open
intervals, however, the ends-points may or may not be part of the
intervals.

Practice
--------

In Pastel, an axis-aligned box is modeled with the `AlignedBox` class
using the min-max representation.

### Topology

Whether the end-points are part of the intervals can be controlled
by changing the topology of the box. On each axis both the min and max
point can be either included or excluded. The default is that the
minimums are closed and the maximums are open.

### Dual role

The `AlignedBox` class template has a dual role in Pastel. First, it
is used to represent integer boxes. This is reflected by the [PastelSys
providing the implementation][SysBox] of the AlignedBox. Second, it is 
used to represent real boxes, i.e. more geometric objects, a view which is 
emphasized by PastelGeometry. It makes sense to implement both by the
same implementation, since some algorithms, for example box intersection
and difference, can be carried out on both types of boxes. While the
implementation is actually in PastelSys, for convenience we provide
similarly named redirection files [[FileLink: alignedbox.h]] and 
[[FileLink: alignedbox_tools.h]] for PastelGeometry, so that all shapes 
in PastelGeometry can be logically found from the same location. Actually,
there is more than just convenience to this, since in the PastelGeometry 
files we provide additional algorithms specific to geometry. Therefore,
when dealing with geometry, you should always include these files, rather
than the PastelSys files.
