A _capsule_ ''S'' in ''RR^n'' is a Minkowski sum of a line segment 
''L'' and an ''r''-radius ball. If ''A'' and ''B'' are the end-points 
of ''L'', then 

	S = {x in RR^n | exists t in [0, 1] sub RR: |(A + t(B - A)) - x| <= r},

where the norm is Euclidean. Here the ''S'' is closed; whether the boundary of 
''S'' is part of ''S'' can be controlled explicitly.
