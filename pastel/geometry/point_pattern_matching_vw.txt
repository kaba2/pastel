This section contains an implementation of the algorithm given in
the paper

_A Fast Expected-Time 2d Point-Pattern Matching Algorithm_,
P.B. Van Wamelen et al., Pattern Recognition 37 (2004), 1699-1711.

This is an efficient randomized algorithm for point-pattern matching
under the class of conformal affine transformations in ''RR^2''.
It is based on examining local neighborhoods of the points of ''Q in RR^2'' and
the points of ''P in RR^2''. Only if the local neighborhoods match, it is 
checked if the match is also global. Such a technique is a fast way to reject
transformation candidates. However, it has certain drawbacks:

 * It might reject a valid transformation.
 * If the point-patterns are highly self-similar (e.g. a grid of points),
 then lots of local neighborhoods match and the algorithm slows down
 remarkably.

The first drawback is taken care by probabilistic arguments: it is accepted
provided that it does not happen often. This is taken care by choosing
the local neighborhood sizes carefully. The second drawback is a general 
problem in point-pattern matching.
