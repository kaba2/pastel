Distance between point-sets
===========================

[[Parent]]: pointset_queries.txt

Theory
------

The _distance_ between two point-sets ''A, B sub RR^n''
is defined by

''D(A, B) = text(inf) {d(a, b) | a in A, b in B}''

where ''d : RR^n -> RR'' is some metric.

Practice
--------

In all distance queries it is assumed that the
objects are solid.
