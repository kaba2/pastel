Point pattern matching design decisions
---------------------------------------

* We will use the algorithm in

"A fast expected time 2d point pattern matching algorithm",
Van Wamelen et al., 2004.

* Need to compute k-nearest neighbours of a given point
=> Store a kd-tree along with the point set.

* Need to see if there is some point in a given delta neighbourhood
=> A grid could give constant complexity for this problem.
=> However, we have already computed the kd-tree. We could
use it to this problem too with some time penalty (however,
we save on memory).

* Only the scene points need the delta-neighbourhood query.

* We could store point patterns simply as kd-trees.
