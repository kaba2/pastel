Practice
--------

This concept is used in nearest neighbors searching and counting to be
able to ignore a set of points during the search. For example, given
a point in a point-set, you might want to exclude the point itself
from the results when searching for k nearest neighbors.
This technique should only be used for small sets of points, since
the points will be processed regardless of whether they are
included in the results or not. In particular, when using the PointKdTree,
you should consider whether it is better to actually remove a point
from the point-set or ignore it.
