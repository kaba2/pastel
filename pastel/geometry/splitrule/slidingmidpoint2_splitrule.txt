Modified sliding midpoint splitting rule
========================================

[[Parent]]: splitrules.txt

The modified sliding midpoint rule chooses to split along the 
longest side of the node. It first places the splitting
position at the middle. It then counts the number of points 
on both sides of the splitting plane and slides the plane into 
contact with the larger point-set. This tends to give larger 
cell of empty space and thus better performance because the 
process is biased towards cutting the empty space away from the 
larger point set. This also guarantees that at least 
one point lies on each splitting plane.

See the sliding midpoint rule for properties: they
are the same.
