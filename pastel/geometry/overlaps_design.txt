GJK vs specialized algorithms
-----------------------------

Given ''n'' types of objects, one needs to implement ''O(n^2)''
algorithms to cover for all pairwise combinations.
The _GJK algorithm_ is able to avoid such a profileration of cases
by abstracting a convex shape by using a so-called _support mapping_.
One algorithm is then sufficient to handle all overlap testing (and more) 
in a large class of convex shapes. The advantages of specialized
testing include:

 * The results are exact (assuming exact arithmetic).
 * The algorithms are probably somewhat faster, as they can use
 information specific to the problem.
 
The disadvantages include:

 * Profileration of cases.
 * No run-time abstraction for shapes. 

The GJK and the specialized algorithms complement each other. An ideal case 
would be to provide both.
