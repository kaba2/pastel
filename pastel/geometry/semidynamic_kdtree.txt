Multi-level kd-tree
===================

[[Parent]]: bsp_tree.txt

Theory
------

A _multi-level kd-tree_ is a point kd-tree in which each node has
access to the points (and their number) under its subtree.

### Illustration

In the following the multi-level kd-tree is illustrated in ''RR^2'' with bucket size 4.

Practice
--------

The multi-level kd-tree allows, in particular, efficient nearest neighbor searching 
for both static and semi-dynamic point sets. See the PointKdTree class for the 
implementation of the corresponding data-structure.
