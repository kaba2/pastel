Time series'
============

[[Parent]]: undocumented.txt

A _time series_ is a function ''f : T --> RR^n'', where ''T'' is an ordered 
set. The argument of ''f'' is called a _time_, while the value of ''f'' is
called a _position_. The corresponding data structure is a collection of 
point-kd-trees. The set of positions is subsivided, based on time, into a 
binary search tree; given a node and its associated time ''t', the positions
with time ''< t'' are placed in the left child node, and the positions
with time ''>= t'' are placed in the right child node. Each node contains
an associated point-kd-tree, which covers the positions in the subtree rooted
at the node.
