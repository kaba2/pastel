Poisson-disk pattern
====================

Theory
------

An _''epsilon''-radius poisson-disk pattern in ''S sub RR^n''_,
''epsilon in RR^+'', is a
finite point set ''P'' for which it holds that the minimum distance
between the points in ''P'' is at least ''epsilon'', with the metric
chosen freely. Such point-sets are said to satisfy the _poisson-disk 
property_. If no point can be added to ''P'' without breaking the 
poisson-disk property, the pattern is called _maximal_. Maximal
poisson-disk patterns are of more interest because otherwise a single
point would satisfy the requirements for any ''epsilon'' and 
non-empty ''S''.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements an algorithm to generate almost-maximal 
poisson-disk patterns inside a rectangular region in ''RR^n''. 
The 'almost' is the consequence of using an algorithm that is based
on randomization.

### Examples

Here is a maximal poisson-disk pattern in ''RR'', where each point has
been extended to a horizontal line for visualization.

Here is a maximal poisson-disk pattern in ''RR^2''.
