Poisson disk pattern
====================

[Parent]: pastelgeometry.txt

Theory
------

An _epsilon-radius poisson disk pattern_ is a point set in R^n which 
is characterized by the property that each ball of radius
epsilon contains only one point. Given a set of points P and
a poisson disk pattern on it, the pattern is called _maximal_
if no points can be added to it.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements an algorithm to generate poisson disk patterns
inside a rectangular region in R^n. These patterns are maximal,
or at least close to being maximal (the algorithm is dependent on
some randomization).
