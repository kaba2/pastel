Axis-aligned box
================

Theory
------

An _axis-aligned box_ ''S'' in ''RR^n'' is a Cartesian product of 
''n'' closed intervals. Alternatively, it is described by two points ''A'' 
and ''B'' in ''RR^n'', such that 

''S = {x in RR^n | \forall i in [1, n] : A_i <= x_i <= B_i}''.

In this representation, ''A'' is called the _minimum point_, and ''B'' is called the _maximum point_.

Practice
--------

In Pastel, an axis-aligned box is modeled with the AlignedBox class
using the min-max representation.

### Integer boxes

As a very special case, we allow `integer` to be passed as the underlying
Real type. This way we avoid having to implement some specific 
algorithms, such as box intersection or box difference, twice for integer 
boxes. Since `integer` does not model the Real concept, not all algorithms
on AlignedBox work on the `integer` type. For this reason we have explicitly
marked in the documentation which algorithms on aligned boxes also work
with integer boxes.
