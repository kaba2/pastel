Axis-aligned box
================

[[Parent]]: shapes.txt

Theory
------

An _axis-aligned box_ ''S'' in ''RR^n'' is a Cartesian product of 
''n'' closed intervals. Alternatively, it is described by two points ''A'' 
and ''B'' in ''RR^n'', such that 

''S = {x in RR^n | \forall i in [1, n] : A_i <= x_i <= B_i}''.

In this representation, ''A'' is called the _minimum point_, and ''B'' is called the _maximum point_.

Practice
--------

In Pastel, an axis-aligned box is modeled with the AlignedBox class
using the min-max representation.
