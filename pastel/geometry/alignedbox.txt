Axis-aligned box
================

[[Parent]]: shapes.txt

Theory
------

An _axis-aligned box_ ''S'' in ''RR^n'' is a Cartesian product of 
''n'' closed intervals. Alternatively, it is described by two points ''A'' 
and ''B'' in ''RR^n'', such that 

''S = {x in RR^n | \forall i in [1, n] : A_i <= x_i <= B_i}''.

In this representation, ''A'' is called the _minimum point_, and 
''B'' is called the _maximum point_.

Practice
--------

In Pastel, an axis-aligned box is modeled with the `AlignedBox` class
using the min-max representation. 

### Dual role

The `AlignedBox` class template has a dual role in Pastel. First, it
is used to represent integer boxes. This is reflected by the [PastelSys
providing the implementation][SysBox] of the AlignedBox. Second, it is 
used to represent real boxes, i.e. more geometric objects, a view which is 
emphasized by PastelGeometry. It makes sense to implement both by the
same implementation, since some algorithms, for example box intersection
and difference, can be carried out on both types of boxes. While the
implementation is actually in PastelSys, for convenience we provide
similarly named redirection files [[File: alignedbox.h]] and 
[[File: alignedbox_tools.h]] for PastelGeometry, so that all shapes 
in PastelGeometry can be logically found from the same location. Actually,
there is more than just convenience to this, since in the PastelGeometry 
files we provide additional algorithms specific to geometry. Therefore,
when dealing with geometry, you should always include these files, rather
than the PastelSys files.
