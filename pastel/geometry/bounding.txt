Theory
------

A _bounding shape_ is a minimal covering shape of type ''A''
for a shape of type ''B'', where 'minimal' usually refers to either 
area or volume. _Bounding_ is the task of finding such a shape.

Practice
--------

In addition to providing algorithms that find minimal covering shapes,
Pastel provides algorithms that do this approximately.
