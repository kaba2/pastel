Bounding shape computation
==========================

[Parent]: pastelgeometry.txt

Theory
------

The problem of bounding is about finding a minimal covering shape of type A
for a shape of type B. The minimal usually refers to either area or volume.

Practice
--------

In addition to providing algorithms that find minimal covering shapes,
Pastel provides algorithms that merely approximate minimality. Their
advantage is simplicity.
