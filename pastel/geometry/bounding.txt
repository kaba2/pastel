Bounding shapes
===============

[[Parent]]: shape_generation.txt

A _bounding shape_ is a minimal covering shape of type ''A''
for a shape of type ''B'', where _minimal_ usually refers to either 
area or volume. _Bounding_ is the problem of finding such a shape.

--------

In addition to providing algorithms that find bounding shapes,
Pastel provides algorithms that do this approximately.
