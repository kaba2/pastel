Bounding
========

[Parent]: pastelgeometry.txt

Theory
------

_To bound_ is to find a minimal covering shape of type ''A''
for a shape of type ''B'', where 'minimal' usually refers to either 
area or volume. The covering shape is called a _bounding shape_. 

Practice
--------

In addition to providing algorithms that find minimal covering shapes,
Pastel provides algorithms that do this approximately.
