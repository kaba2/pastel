Maximum clique of aligned boxes
===============================

Theory
------

Given a set ''P'' of (axis-aligned) boxes in ''R^d'', ''|P| = n''. 
A _clique box_ is a box which is contained in the intersection of 
some subset ''hat(P) sub P'' of boxes. The _box maximum clique 
problem_ is to find a clique box such that ''|hat(P)| = k'' is maximized.
Such a box is then called a _maximum clique box_. There can be several 
maximum clique boxes, even if each box is made maximal.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements an algorithm to find a maximum clique box in
time ''O(n log(n))'', and to optionally report the subset ''hat(P)''
using additional ''O(k)'' time. Consider the subset of those boxes that
intersect a given horizontal line. We call the maximum cliques in that
subset the _local maximum cliques_. For each local maximum clique set,
the algorithm samples randomly (using a uniform distribution) one of
them for further global investigation. Among the sampled local maximum
cliques, the algorithm primarily maximizes the area, and secondarily 
(in case of equal area, especially zero area) the maximum width or 
height.

The algorithm allows to choose whether to treat boxes as open or closed 
sets. Note that if one side of a box is open and the other side is 
closed, then the results are equivalent to both sides being open.

### Example of local maximum clique sampling

Figure 1 demonstrates that, even in ''R^2'', ''n'' boxes can form
''O(n^2)'' maximum cliques (here ''n = 16''). In this image the red 
lines are boxes of width zero, and the there are four transparent blue 
boxes of thicker width. It is easy to show for such a gridding of boxes 
that the probability that the algorithm returns a singular maximum clique
box is given by ''1 - (1 - 4 / n)^(n / 2)'', which for ''n = 16'' 
evaluates to ''0.90''. Furthermore, if we let ''n'' grow, then this 
probability very quickly converges from above towards 
''1 - e^{-2} ~= 0.86''. Thus with quite good probability the algorithm 
returns a non-singular maximum clique box. Similarly, the probability 
that the algorithm returns one of the four large-area maximum cliques 
is given by ''1 - (1 - 4 / n)^2'', which for ''n = 16'' evaluates to
0.44, but approaches zero as ''n'' grows.
