Poisson-disk pattern
====================

[[Parent]]: shape_generation.txt

An _''epsilon''-radius poisson-disk pattern_ in ''S sub RR^n'',
''epsilon in RR^+'', is a point-set ''P'' for which it holds that the 
minimum distance between the points in ''P'' is at least ''epsilon'', with 
the metric chosen freely. Such point-sets are said to satisfy the 
_poisson-disk property_. If no point can be added to ''P'' without 
breaking the poisson-disk property, the pattern is called _maximal_. 
Maximal poisson-disk patterns are of more interest because otherwise 
a single point would satisfy the requirements for any ''epsilon'' and 
non-empty ''S''.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements an algorithm to generate almost-maximal 
poisson-disk patterns inside a rectangular region in ''RR^n''. 
The 'almost' is the consequence of using an algorithm that is based
on randomization.

### Examples

Here are maximal poisson-disk patterns in ''RR^2'' and ''RR''.
