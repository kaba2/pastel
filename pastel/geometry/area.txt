We define the area of a point set in R^n as the 
(n-1)-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the boundary 
of the point set. Note that this definition might
be a bit surprising for those who have not accustomed
to it: the area of a sphere of radius r in R^2 is 2 pi r
(and its volume is pi r^2). But it is the correct
generalization when considering geometric applications. 
One example is given by the surface area heuristic 
when building kd-trees for ray tracing.
