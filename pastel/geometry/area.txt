Area computation
================

Theory
------

The _area_ of a point-set in ''RR^n'' is the ''(n-1)''-dimensional 
Lebesgue measure of the boundary of the point-set.

Practice

The definition of area given here might be a bit surprising 
for those who have not accustomed to it: the area of a sphere of 
radius ''r'' in ''RR^2'' is ''2 pi r'' (and its volume is ''pi r^2''). 
However, it is the correct generalization when considering geometric 
applications. One example is given by the surface area heuristic 
when building kd-trees for ray tracing.
