Area of a shape
===============

Theory
------

The _area_ of a shape in ''RR^n'' is the ''(n-1)''-dimensional 
Lebesgue measure of the boundary of the point-set.

Practice
--------

The definition of area given here might be a bit surprising 
for those who have not accustomed to it. For example, the area of a sphere of 
radius ''r'' in ''RR^2'' is ''2 pi r'', and not ''pi r^2'' (which is its volume). 
However, it is the correct generalization when considering geometric 
applications. One example is given by the surface area heuristic 
when building kd-trees for ray tracing.
