Range searching in a kd-tree
============================

[[Parent]]: searching.txt

Given a finite point-set ''P sub RR^n'' and a shape ''B sub RR^n'', the _range searching_ problem is to report the set ''P cap B''. When the shape ''B'' is an axis-aligned box, the problem is called _orthogonal range searching_.
