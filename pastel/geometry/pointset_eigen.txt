Eigenstructure of a point-set
=============================

[[Parent]]: geometric_algorithms.txt

An _eigenvector of a point-set_ is an eigenvector
of the covariance matrix of the point-set.
An _eigenvalue of a point-set_ is an eigenvalue
corresponding to an eigenvector of the point-set.

Practice
--------

Pastel uses the PASTd algorithm to efficiently compute approximate
eigenvectors and eigenvalues for point-sets.
