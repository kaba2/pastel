Intersections between shapes
============================

Theory
------

The _intersection_ ''S'' between two shapes ''A'' and ''B'' in ''RR^n''
is ''S = A nn B''.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements several algorithms to find the intersection between
a pair of shapes. Describing the possible intersection shape is slower 
than simply finding out if shapes overlap. If this is the need, you
should use the algorithms for overlap testing instead.
