Given a point set P in R^n, and a query point q in R^n, not necessarily in P, 
the exact nearest neighbor problem asks for the k nearest points in P for q.
The approximate nearest neighbor problem in turn asks for k points in P
that have no more than an (1 + epsilon) amount of relative error when
comparing the distances to the found neighbors and the distances to the 
exact neighbors.
