Overlap testing
===============

[Parent]: pastelgeometry.txt

Theory
------

Two shapes overlap if their intersection is non-empty.

Practice
--------

Testing for overlap is an easier problem than finding
and describing the intersection shape. Pastel implements
several overlap tests between pairs of shapes.
