Overlap testing
===============

[Parent]: pastelgeometry.txt

Theory
------

Testing for any two point sets in R^n for overlap means
to check if their intersection is empty. This is an easier 
problem than actually finding the intersection set and can
in many cases be solved much faster.

To actually implement an algorithm, the point sets must be
restricted in some way. A particularly easy class of point
sets are those of convex sets.

Practice
--------

Pastel allows to represent several kinds of simple convex
point sets. These include aligned boxes, boxes, spheres, 
capsules, planes, line segments, lines, and simplices.

GJK vs specialized algorithms
-----------------------------

Given n types of objects, one needs to implement O(n^2)
algorithms to cover for all pairwise combinations.
While there exists an iterative algorithm (the GJK algorithm) 
to perform overlap testing between arbitrary convex sets 
(for which a so-called support mapping can be implemented),
the advantage of these hand-tuned tests include that they
can be implemented very efficiently and that their result
is exact (rather than the result of cutting a convergent 
sequence epsilon away from the correct answer).
