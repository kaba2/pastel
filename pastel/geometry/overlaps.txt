Overlap between point-sets
==========================

[[Parent]]: pointset_queries.txt

Theory
------

Two point-sets ''P, Q sub RR^n'' _overlap_ if their intersection is non-empty.

Practice
--------

Testing for overlap is an easier problem than finding
and describing the intersection-shape. Pastel implements
several overlap tests between pairs of shapes.
