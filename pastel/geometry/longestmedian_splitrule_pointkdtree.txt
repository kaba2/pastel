Median-of-longest-side splitting rule
=====================================

[[Parent]]: splitrule_pointkdtree.txt

The median-of-longest-side rule chooses to split along the longest
side of the node. On this axis it chooses to split at the median of 
the contained points.

### Advantages

 * Tree depth is bounded by log2(n).
 
 * The tree satisfies a packing lemma which guarantees
excellent worst-case performance on approximate nearest neighbors
searching and approximate range searching.

### Disadvantages

 * There are quite many thin nodes. This is the price
 to pay for the guaranteed logarithmic depth.
 
 * Because of the previous, in practice this
 rule results in slower performance than the sliding midpoint 
 rule.
