======================

[[Parent]]: geometric_algorithms.txt

_Point-set registration_ is the problem of finding a locally 
optimal transformation between two unpaired point-sets,
for some class of transformations, and for some criterion of
optimality. The corresponding global problem is called
[point pattern matching][PPM].
