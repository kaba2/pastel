### Cell-complex

An _n-dimensional cell-complex_ ''C'', is an (n + 1)-tuple
''C = (C_0, C_1, ..., C_n)'', such that 

 * ''C_0'' is a finite family of singular subsets of ''RR^n''.

 * ''\forall k > 0: C_k'' is a finite family of subsets of ''RR^n'' each 
 homeomorphic to ''[0, 1]^k''.
 
 * ''\forall k > 0: \forall c in C_k: \exists S sub C_{k - 1}: del c = uu S'',
 where ''del c'' denotes the boundary of ''c''.
 
The elements of the set ''C_k'' are called _k-cells_.
A _mesh_ is an alternative name for a cell-complex.

### Embeddings

A cell-complex is purely a _topological_ description: in itself it says nothing about
the geometry of the cells. The essential part in the description is
how the cells of different dimensionality relate to each other, and how
the cells of the same dimensionality glue together by sharing boundary cells.
These properties are clearly invariant under homeomorphisms. 
In a geometric application, a mesh is associated with geometry by mapping cells 
to ''RR^m'', a process which is called _embedding_. 
Familiar embeddings include:
 
 * _Flat embedding_ of a 2-cell-complex to ''RR^2'': 
 0-cells to points, 1-cells to line segments, and 2-cells to polygons.
 
 * _Flat embedding_ of a 3-cell-complex to ''RR^3'': 
 0-cells to points, 1-cells to line segments, 2-cells to planar 
 polygons, and 3-cells to polyhedrons.
 
 * _Spherical embedding_ of a 2-cell-complex to a sphere in ''RR^3'': 
 0-cells to points, 1-cells to spherical line segments, and 
 2-cells to spherical polygons.

Or more generally:

 * _Flat embedding_ of an n-cell-complex to ''RR^n''.
 
 * _Spherical embedding_ of a (n-1)-cell-complex to a sphere in ''RR^n''.
 
Or even more generally:
 
 * _Flat embedding_ of an m-cell-complex to a k-flat in ''RR^n''.
 
 * _Spherical embedding_ of a m-cell-complex to a k-sphere in ''RR^n''.
 
I.e. the embeddings can be to a sub-manifold of ''RR^n (m <= n)'',
and they don't necessarily need to preserve dimensionality ''(k < m)''.
