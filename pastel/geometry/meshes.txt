Mesh data structures
====================

[Parent]: needs_more_thought.txt

A _mesh_ is a cell complex.
Mesh data structures store cell complexes, or subsets
of them. Meshes are purely topological or combinatorial
objects and thus no geometry is associated with them as
they are. However, they can be embedded into a geometric
space by associating the elements with geometric
counterparts.
