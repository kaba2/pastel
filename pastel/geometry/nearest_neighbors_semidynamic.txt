A _semi-dynamic point-set_ is a function ''f : NN -> 2^P''. 

Practice
--------

A semi-dynamic point-set is a time-varying finite point-set whose 
points are drawn from ''P''. At each time instant some of the points 
are (possibly) removed and some are inserted. Usually, when talking 
about semi-dynamic point-sets, one assumes that only a small part of 
the active set is changed at each time instant, i.e., that there is 
some _temporal coherence_. This assumption allows to think of more 
efficient algorithms for this specific case.

The problem is to search for nearest neighbors in a semi-dynamic point 
set. An obvious way to do this is to repeat a standard nearest neighbor 
search from the stratch at each time instant. However, this is inefficient 
because the temporal coherence is not taken advantage of. Specifically 
to address this problem, Pastel implements the _multi-level kd-tree_, 
which maintains efficient searches and avoids reconstruction. Using 
this data structure, the problem is approached by constructing the 
kd-tree based on all points in ''P''. Then, at each time step, nearest 
neighbors are searched, and points are removed and inserted incrementally.
