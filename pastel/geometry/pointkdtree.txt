Multi-level kd-tree
===================

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

A _multi-level kd-tree_ is a point kd-tree in which each node has
access to the points (and their number) under its subtree.

Practice
--------

The `PointKdTree` class is a data structure for storing and 
manipulating a multi-level kd-tree. It is declared as:

[[CppCode]]:
	template <typename Real, int N = Dynamic, 
		typename PointPolicy = Vector_PointPolicy<Real, N> >
	class PointKdTree;

where `N` is the dimensionality of the tree, `Real` is a computation
type which models an [ordered field][Real], and `PointPolicy` defines
the [representation of points][PointPolicy]. The dimensionality can be 
set to `Dynamic` meaning that it is chosen at runtime.

### Traversal of the subdivision using cursors

The nodes of the kd-tree are traversed using [cursors][Cursor]. 
From each node you can traverse either to a parent (if it exists) 
or to left or right child (if they exist). At each node you can inspect:

 * How many points are stored under the sub-tree whose root-node 
 the current node is?
 
 * What those points are? (iterator range to the point list).
 
 * What are the node bounds on the splitting dimension?
 
 * What are the cursors to the child nodes?
 
 * What is the cursor to the parent node?

### Features

 * The points stored in the kd-tree are traversed through
an iterator interface. Note that their order
can change after subdivision, and if a point is removed and
immediately inserted back, it might take another position in 
the point list.

 * Points can be inserted into the tree at any time, either one
by one or as a set. No new nodes are created in this process.

 * Points can be removed from the tree at any time. This can be
done either one by one, or by removing all points at once.

 * The recursive subdivision of the kd-tree can be refined
at any time. In this process existing leaf nodes are converted
into split nodes by recursively subdividing them into two new leaf 
nodes. The split plane is chosen by a _splitting rule_.

 * Each split node contains the bounds of the node on
the splitting axis. Knowing these bounds is essential in
the implementation of an efficient nearest neighbor
searching algorithm.
