Orthogonal range searching
==========================

[[Parent]]: geometric_algorithms.txt

Given a finite point-set ''P sub RR^n'' and a shape ''B sub RR^n'', 
the _range searching_ problem asks to report all the points in ''P'' that
intersect with ''B''. The _range counting_ problem
asks instead to report the number of points a range search would find,
which is an easier problem. When the shape ''B'' is an axis-aligned box, 
the problems are prefixed with the term _orthogonal_.
