Ellipsoid
=========

[[Parent]]: shapes.txt

An _ellipsoid_ is an affine transform of a sphere.

Theory
------

Alternatively, a subset ''Q sub RR^n'' is called
an ellipsoid if

''\exists c in RR^n, S in RR^{n xx n}: Q = {x in RR^n : (x - c)^T S (x - c) <= 1}''

where ''S'' is symmetric and positive-semi-definite.
If such ''c'' and ''S'' can be found, then ''c'' is called the _center_
of the ellipsoid, and ''S'' is called the _quadratic form matrix_
of the ellipsoid.
