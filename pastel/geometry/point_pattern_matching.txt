Point-pattern matching
======================

[[Parent]]: transformation_fitting.txt

Let ''P = {p_1, ..., p_m}'' and ''Q = {q_1, ..., q_s}'' be
two finite point-sets in ''RR^n''. Given some class of 
transformations, such as the class of affine, conformal affine, 
rigid, or projective transformations, the problem of
_point-pattern matching_ is to find a transformation in that class 
which maps ''P'' to ''Q'' _well enough_. 

Theory
------

Ideally, one would give an
''epsilon in RR'' as a parameter such that a transformation is good 
enough if the image of each point ''p_i'' has a unique nearest neighbor 
''q_{j(i)}'' in its ''epsilon''-neighborhood (under some chosen metric). 
The ''epsilon'' is called the _matching distance_. 
If there is no solution, then the algorithm should report so, and if 
there are multiple such solutions, then any of them will do. 
However, in practical problems both ''P'' and ''Q'' can be missing some 
points, or have some extraneous points. Thus the condition for a good 
transformation is relaxed by requiring only a percentage of the points of
''P'' to satisfy the ''epsilon''-criterion.
