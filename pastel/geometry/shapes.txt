Shapes

Theory
------

A _shape_ is a closed subset of ''RR^n''. A shape ''S'' is called
_convex_, if it holds that 

''A, B in S => \forall t in [0, 1]: A + t(B - A) in S''.

A shape that is not convex is called _concave_. 
Shapes ''S_1'' and ''S_2'' _overlap_ if their intersection
is non-empty.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements various shapes, of which most are convex.
The reason for this is that overlap testing between convex
shapes is easier than between concave shapes.

### Operator overloading

All shapes overload the operators +=, +, -=, and - to translate
by a vector and the operators *=, *, /=, and / to scale by a real number.
The scaling is always defined for a given shape so
that the it commutes with translation.
