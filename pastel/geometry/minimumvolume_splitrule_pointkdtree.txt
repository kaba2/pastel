Minimum-volume splitting rule
=============================

[[Parent]]: splitrule_pointkdtree.txt

This splitting rule only makes sense for a bounding interval tree.
The _minimum-volume_ splitting rule chooses the split plane as follows.
On each axis it considers the percentage of empty space that is cut out
of a node. It chooses the splitting axis and position by maximizing
the resulting empty space (and thus minimizing the volume of the resulting
child nodes). However, the median of the longest side is chosen instead if:
 
 * the cut-out is less than 25%, or
 * the median can provide at least 75% of the cut-out.
