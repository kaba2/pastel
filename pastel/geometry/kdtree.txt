KdTree class
============

[[Parent]]: bsp_trees.txt

The `KdTree` class is a data-structure for storing and manipulating
a kd-tree which contains shapes. The primary purpose of this
data-structure is to accelerate ray casting in ray tracing
algorithms. If you need a data-structure for a point kd-tree
instead, see the [PointKdTree][PointKdTree] class.
