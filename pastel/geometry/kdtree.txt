--------

The KdTree class is a data-structure for storing and manipulating
a kd-tree which contains shapes. This primary purpose of this
data-structure is to accelerate ray casting in ray tracing
algorithms. If you need a data-structure for a point kd-tree
instead, see the PointKdTree class.
