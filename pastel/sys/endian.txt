Endian conversions
==================

Theory
------

Processor manufacturers present us with two major ways of storing a 
multi-byte integer into memory. _Little endians_ list the bytes from 
the least significant to the most signifact. The _big endians_, in 
contrast, list the bytes from the most signifact to the least 
significant. When data is stored into files using a direct binary 
representation, the storage order must be chosen as well. Therefore,
when loading from or saving to files, we are presented with two 
practical problems:

1. Checking which _endianness_ the computer has. 
2. Converting from the endianness used in the file to the
endianness used in the computer (or vice versa).

Practice
--------

Pastel provides functions for checking the endianness of the
computer as well as converting between endiannesses.
