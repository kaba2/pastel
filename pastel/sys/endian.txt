Endian conversions
==================

Processor manufacturers present us with two major ways of storing a 
multi-byte integer into memory. _Little endians_ list the bytes from 
the least significant to the most signifact. The _big endians_, in 
contrast, list the bytes from the most signifact to the least 
significant. 

Endian conversions

When data is stored into files using a direct binary 
representation, the storage order must be chosen as well. Therefore,
when loading from or saving to files, we are presented with two 
practical problems:

1. Checking which _endianness_ the computer has. 
2. Converting from the endianness used in the file to the
endianness used in the computer (or vice versa).

Pastel provides functions for both of these tasks.
