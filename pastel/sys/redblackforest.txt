Red-black forest
================

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

A _red-black forest_ is a data-structure for storing and manipulating a locally ordered sequence. It consists of a sequence of [red-black trees][RedBlack], with the end-nodes in a doubly-linked list. A red-black forest is useful because it offers a way to do finger searches; the trees localize the searches. The red-black forest implementation in Pastel has the following properties:

Task / Property                                           | Complexity
----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------
Insert/remove an empty tree.                              | ''O(1)''
Move a tree to another forest.                            | ''O(1)''
Move all trees to another forest.                         | ''O(1)''
Find out the number of trees.                             | ''O(1)''
Find the next/previous tree, given a tree.                | ''O(1)''
Find the next/previous element, given an element.         | ''O(1)'' amortized + ''O(k)''
Find the containing tree, given an element.               | ''O(log(n_i))''
Space                                                     | ''O(n)''

Here ''n'' is the number of elements in the forest, and ''n_i'' is the number of elements in the ''i'':th set, with ''{j, k} = {i, i + 1}'' such that ''n_k <= n_j''. The ''k'' is the number of empty trees that must be skipped to get to the next/previous element.

Versus truncated skip-list
--------------------------

A [truncated skip-list][SkipList] can also do finger searches, using the elements itself as fingers. The problem is that the height of the truncated skip-list must be fixed, and therefore its insertion and removal can not be completely localized. In addition, a red-black tree is faster and more space-efficient than a skip-list, while also supporting propagation data.
