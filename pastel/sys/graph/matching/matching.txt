Graph matching
==============

[[Parent]]: graph_algorithms.txt

A _matching_ in a directed graph ''G = (V, E)'', where ''E subset V^2'', is a subset ''M sub E'', such that the edges in ''M''do not share vertices. A _maximal matching_ in ''G'' is a matching ''M'' in ''G'' which is not a proper subset of another matching in ''G''. A _maximum matching_ in ''G'' is a matching ''M'' in ''G'' of maximum cardinality ''|M|''.
