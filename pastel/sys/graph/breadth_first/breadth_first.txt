Breadth-first traversal
=======================

[[Parent]]: graph_traversal.txt

The _breadth-first traversal_ is an algorithm for traversing the 
vertices of a graph. The `BreadthFirst_GraphTraversal` class provides 
an algorithm-object for breadth-first traversal.

Algorithm
---------

The algorithm first pushes all the _seed_ vertices at the back of a 
queue. As long as there is a vertex ''v'' at the front of the queue, 
the algorithm marks ''v'', removes ''v'' from the queue, and then 
pushes all the unmarked adjacent vertices of ''v'' at the back of 
the queue.
