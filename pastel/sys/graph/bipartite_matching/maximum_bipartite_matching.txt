Maximum bipartite matching
==========================

[[Parent]]: graph_algorithms.txt

A graph ''G = (V, E)'', ''E sub V xx V'', is called _bipartite_, 
if ''V'' can be given as a union of disjoint sets ''L, R subset V'' 
such that ''(L xx L) nn E = O/'' and ''(R xx R) nn E = O/''.
A _matching_ in ''G'' is a subset ''M sub E'' such that the edges in ''M''
do not share vertices. A _maximum matching_ is a matching ''M'' of maximum
cardinality ''|M|''.
