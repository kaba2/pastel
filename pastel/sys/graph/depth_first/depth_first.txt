Depth-first traversal
=====================

[[Parent]]: graph_traversal.txt

The _depth-first traversal_ is an algorithm for traversing the 
vertices of a graph. The `DepthFirst_GraphTraversal` class 
provides an algorithm-object for depth-first traversal.

Algorithm
---------

The algorithm first pushes all the _seed_ vertices at the back
of a stack. As long as there is a vertex ''v'' at the back of the 
stack, the algorithm marks ''v'', removes ''v'' from the stack, and 
then pushes all the unmarked adjacent vertices of ''v'' at the back 
of the stack. 

This description parallels that for the breadth-first search. However, 
the traversal is commonly implemented by recursive function calls for 
efficiency; the stack is then implicit as the function call stack.
