Algorithm concept
=================

An _algorithm_, as a concept, is an object which encapsulates a _generic_
algorithm. 

Motivation
----------

In generic programming, it is often desirable to parametrize an algorithm
by sub-algorithms. For example, a nearest-neighbor search algorithm over
kd-trees might be parametrized by the traversal order of nodes. This can be
encapsulated into an algorithm object, which the user passes to the search
function, and used as a sub-algorithm.

Compared to the usual use of functors, the algorithm objects are different
in that usually the functors are not templated. Instead, the usual functors 
carry only a specific type of function, such as std::less\<int\>() passed to 
std::sort(). Using the algorithm concept, one would instead pass a LessThan()
algorithm which encapsulates a less-than comparison for all types.
