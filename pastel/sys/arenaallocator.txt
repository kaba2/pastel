ArenaAllocator class
====================

Practice
--------

In situations where dynamic allocation and deallocation
of small objects is frequent and large scale, the performance
of the native allocator can often be enhanced substantially in some
restricted cases. One such case is where allocations can happen 
at any time, but deallocation of the objects is done all at once. 
This allows for minimal book-keeping and very fast allocation and
deallocation. ArenaAllocator reserves memory in big blocks
which it then shares in required pieces. ArenaAllocator only 
allocates raw memory, construction and destruction of objects is 
left to the user of the memory.
