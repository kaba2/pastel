Y-fast trie design notes
========================

[[Parent]]: yfasttrie.txt

Two levels
----------

A y-fast trie has two levels: the trie itself, and the binary search
trees (buckets) which hang from the leaf nodes of this trie. How should this be exposed to outside?

### Abstracted iterators

In this option the trie is abstracted as a sequence. Here an iterator holds both the current leaf node (a leaf node iterator), and the current position inside the bucket of that leaf node (a bucket iterator).

### Separated iterators

In this option the trie interface also divides into two. There are iterators for the trie nodes (not just leaf nodes), and there are iterators inside a bucket.

### Both

In this option the trie offers both kinds of iterators.
