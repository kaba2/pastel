Predicate concept
=================

[[Parent]]: algorithm.txt

The _predicate_ concept is a refinement of the algorithm concept. 
It defines an algorithm which takes two arbitrary arguments
and returns a boolean result.

Example
-------

Sorting is usually carried out something like this:

[[CppCode]]:
	std::sort(begin, end, std::greater<int>());
	
With predicate objects we write this:

[[CppCode]]:
	std::sort(begin, end, GreaterThan());
