==========================

[[Parent]]: algorithm.txt

The _relation algorithm_ concept is a refinement of the algorithm 
concept. It defines an algorithm which takes two arbitrary arguments
and returns a boolean result.

Example
-------

Sorting is usually carried out something like this:

[[CppCode]]:
	std::sort(begin, end, std::greater<int>());
	
With relation algorithm objects we write this:

[[CppCode]]:
	std::sort(begin, end, GreaterThan());
