### Mersenne Twister

_Mersenne Twister_ is a fast, high-quality pseudo-random number 
generator with a period of ''2^19937 - 1''. Because of these properties, 
many libraries have chosen it as the default random number generator,
including Matlab and Python's standard library. It is also the choice in 
Pastel where it is used to generate pseudo-random integers. 

### Random real number distributions

Pastel allows to generate random real numbers from a range of
useful distributions. These include:

 * Uniform in [0, 1], ]0, 1], [0, 1[, and ]0, 1[.
 * Triangle
 * Gaussian
 * Generalized Gaussian
 * Log-Normal
 * Exponential
 * Laplace
 * Gamma
 * Beta
 * Dirichlet
 * Cauchy
 * Chi-squared

For each distribution Pastel also provides its probability 
density function and the ability to generate vectors of
random numbers. If a parameter corresponds to a simple
translation of the random variable, the parameter is not 
included because it can be trivially added by the user. 
This simplifies the interface.
