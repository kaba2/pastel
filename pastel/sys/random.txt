Random-number generation
------------------------

Pastel allows to generate random-numbers from a range of
useful distributions. The basic idea behind this process is
to take a random number (or two) generated from a uniform distribution
and then distort it to the desired distribution (or use some
other ideas such as rejection sampling). Pastel uses the
Boost library to generate the random variables from the uniform
distribution (using the Mersenne Twister algorithm), but implements the 
distortions itself. The distributions from which random-number
can be generated include:

 * Uniform
 
 * Gaussian (normal)
 
 * Generalized Gaussian

 * Exponential
 
 * Laplace
 
 * Gamma
 
 * Beta
 
 * Dirichlet
 
Note that the Gamma and Generalized Gaussian distributions are not
provided by the Boost library.
