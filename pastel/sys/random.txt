Random number generation
------------------------

Pastel allows to generate random numbers from a range of
useful distributions. These include:

 * Uniform
 
 * Gaussian (normal)
 
 * Generalized Gaussian

 * Exponential
 
 * Laplace
 
 * Gamma
 
 * Beta
 
 * Dirichlet

For each distribution Pastel also provides its probability 
density function.
