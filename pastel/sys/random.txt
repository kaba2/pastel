Random number generation
------------------------

Pastel allows to generate random numbers from a range of
useful distributions. These include:

 * Uniform
 
 * Triangle
 
 * Gaussian
 
 * Generalized Gaussian
 
 * Log-Normal

 * Exponential
 
 * Laplace
 
 * Gamma
 
 * Beta
 
 * Dirichlet
 
 * Cauchy
 
 * Chi-squared

For each distribution Pastel also provides its probability 
density function and the ability to generate vectors of
random numbers.
