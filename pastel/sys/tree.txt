Generic binary tree
===================

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

The `Tree` class implements a generic binary tree data structure.
Its purpose is to work as a back-end for more structured trees,
such as a red-black tree, a kd-tree, or an expression tree; it 
is meant as a reusable low-level component for a library 
writer. As a library user you should not have to bother with 
this class.
