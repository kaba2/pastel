Order relation algorithm concept
================================

[[Parent]]: relationalgorithm.txt

The _order relation algorithm_ concept is a refinement of the relation
algorithm concept. It requires that the relation be a strict total order 
relation. That is, it must be asymmetric, transitive, and total.

Example
-------

Sorting is usually carried out something like this:

[[CppCode]]:
	std::sort(begin, end, std::greater<int>());
	
With order relation algorithm objects we write something like this:

[[CppCode]]:
	class LessThan
	{
	public:
		template <typename A, typename B>
		bool operator()(const A& a, const B& b) const
		{
			return a < b;
		}
	};
	
	std::sort(begin, end, LessThan());
