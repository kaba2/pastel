Practice

There are several obvious algorithms that should have been included
in the set of algorithms provided by the C++ Standard Library, such
as copy_n and the destruction of a range of objects.
While waiting for them to be included in the next standard C++0x,
these algorithms are implemented here. They are enclosed in the
Pastel::StdExt namespace.
