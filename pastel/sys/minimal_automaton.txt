Minimal finite-state automaton
==============================

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

The `MinimalAutomaton` is a data-structure for storing and modifying
minimal (deterministic) finite-state automata. The data-structure takes 
in a [finite-state automaton][Automaton], minimizes it, and from there 
after preserves the property of the automaton being minimal under the 
operations permitted by the data structure. The automaton can be
modified by either adding or removing words to the language recognized
by the automaton.
