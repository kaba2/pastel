Minimal finite-state automaton
==============================

The `MinimalAutomaton` is a data-structure for storing and modifying
minimal (deterministic) finite-state automata. The data-structure takes 
in a [finite-state automaton][Automaton], minimizes it, and after that
preserves the property of the automaton being minimal under the 
operations permitted by the data structure. The automaton can be
modified by either adding or removing words to the language recognized
by the automaton.
