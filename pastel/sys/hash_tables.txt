Hash tables
===========

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

_Hashing_ is a technique which allows for constant-time associative 
searches in many practical cases. The hash tables in Pastel 
implement, except for a differing [allocator model][Allocator], 
the TR1 library proposals for the hash-based containers in the C++ 
Standard Library. When the elements can be hashed, and the storage 
order does not matter, it is preferable to use hash tables instead 
of binary search trees.

_Petri Lehtinen_ implemented both of the `UnorderedMap` and 
`UnorderedSet` containers.
