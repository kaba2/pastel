Automaton design notes
======================

Goals
-----

 * automata must be mergable in constant time, to enable the incremental 
 construction of automata recognizing regular expressions,
 * for a given state, one can get a list all the incoming and outgoing 
 transitions (and get their number) in constant time,
 * user-data can be associated with states and transitions,
