Ranges

A _range_ is a sequence of elements of some specific type. The elements 
of a range are said to be _in the range_. A _forward range_ is a range 
whose first element can be accessed, and which can reduce itself to refer 
to all elements, except the first. A _bidirectional range_ is a forward 
range whose last element can be accessed, and which can reduce itself to 
refer to all elements, except the last. A _random-access range_ is a 
bidirectional range whose n:th element can be accessed.

The first and last elements of a range are guaranteed to exist as long 
as they are in the range. Actual range implementations may give
additional persistence guarantees.

If a range contains no elements, then it is called _empty_. Every range
can be queried for emptiness. The _size of a range_ is the number of
elements in the range. A size of zero is equivalent to emptiness.

If a range is infinite, or finite but unknown, then the size is defined
as -1.
