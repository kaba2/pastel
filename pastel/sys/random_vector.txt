Uniform sampling
================

[Parent]: random.txt

Theory
------

Let V be a subset of R^n. Uniform sampling of V
means to generate random samples from V such that
the distribution of the random samples is uniform on V.

Practice
--------

A general algorithm to uniformly sample any
set V is to bound it with an axis aligned box B,
draw samples from a uniform distribution on B,
and accept only those samples which are also
in V. This is called _rejection sampling_. The
probability that a sample drawn from B is also
in V is the ratio of the measures of V and B.
Thus the efficiency is highly dependent on this
ratio. Unfortunately, this ratio is often low,
or even zero. For example, uniformly sampling
the surface of a sphere in R^3 would not succeed
using rejection sampling in the described manner.

Thus, more than often it is either necessary,
or much more efficient, to generate uniform
samplings via slightly more complex algorithms.
Pastel implements efficient algorithms to
uniform sample from:

 * box in R^n
 * sphere (surface) in R^n
 * ball in R^n
 * annulus in R^n

If instead you need to distort an existing uniform sampling
from one shape to another, see the link at the bottom.
