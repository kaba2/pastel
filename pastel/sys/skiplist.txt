Skip list
=========

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

A _skip list_ is a randomized data structure for storing 
an ordered set, which

* can insert an element in expected ''O(log(n + 2))'' time,
* can remove an element by a value in expected ''O(k log(n + 2))'' time,
where ''k'' is the number of equivalent elements,
* can remove an element by an iterator in ''O(1)'' time,
* can find the first element greater-than-or-equal-to/greater-than/equivalent-to a given element in expected ''O(log(n + 2))'' time, and
* has expected space complexity of ''O(n + 1)''.

In addition, the skip list implementation in Pastel

* supports finger-searches, where a search starts from a specified iterator. Then the search takes only expected ''O(log(Delta + 2))'' time, where ''Delta'' is the distance between the start-iterator and the returned iterator,
* supports associated data, without using any memory if such is not needed,
* supports multiple equivalent elements, stably stored in insertion order, 
* has a performance independent of the number of equivalent elements (that is, in the time-complexities above ''n'' is the number of _unique_ keys), and
* can report the number of equivalent elements for a given iterator in ''O(1)''.
