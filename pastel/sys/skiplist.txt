Deterministic skip list
=======================

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

The _deterministic skip list_ is a data structure which implements a dynamic 
ordered dictionary. 

Properties
----------

Let ''n in NN'' be the number of stored elements, ''m in NN'' be the 
number of unique stored elements, and ''Delta in NN'' be the link-distance, 
along unique elements, between a given stored element (a _finger_) and the 
searched element. Then the implementation of the deterministic skip-list in 
Pastel has the following properties:

Property                             | Complexity
------------------------------------ | -------------------------
Insert an element                    | ''O(log(m))''
Remove an element                    | ''O(log(m))''
Find an element                      | ''O(log(Delta))''
Find the predecessor of an element   | ''O(log(Delta))''
Find the successor of an element     | ''O(log(Delta))''
Count number of equivalent elements  | ''O(1)''
Space                                | ''O(n)''

The deterministic skip list implementation in Pastel supports associated data, without using any memory if such is not needed. If there are multiple equivalent elements in the skip list, then they are stored in the order they were inserted.
