Skip list
=========

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

A _skip-list_ is a probabilistic data structure for storing 
an ordered set, which supports

* inserting an element in expected ''O(log(n))'' time,
* removing an element by a value in expected ''O(log(n))'' time,
* removing an element by an iterator in ''O(1)'' time, and
* searching for the first element greater-than-or-equal-to/greater-than/equivalent-to a given element in expected ''O(log(n))'' time.

The space consumption of the skip-list is ''O(n)''. The [red-black tree][RedBlack] improves on these times by removing the expectations. However, skip-lists still have their uses in specialized algorithms.
