Deterministic skip list
=======================

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

The _deterministic skip list_ is a data structure which implements a 
dynamic ordered dictionary. From now on we shall abbreviate the 
deterministic skip list as a skip list. The _local skip list_ is a 
skip list in which the height of the skip list is bounded from above 
by a constant.

Properties
----------

Let ''n in NN'' be the number of stored elements, ''m in NN'' be the 
number of unique stored elements, and ''Delta in NN'' be the link-distance, 
along unique elements, between a given stored element and the searched 
element. The implementation of the deterministic skip-list in 
Pastel has the following properties:

Property                             | Complexity
------------------------------------ | -------------------------
Insert an element.                   | ''O(log(m))''
Remove an element.                   | ''O(log(m))''
Find an element.                     | ''O(log(Delta))''
Find the predecessor of an element.  | ''O(log(Delta))''
Find the successor of an element.    | ''O(log(Delta))''
Count number of equivalent elements. | ''O(1)''
Space                                | ''O(n)''

Additional properties are as follows:

* supports associated data. If such is not needed, the `void` type 
can be used, and no memory will be used for the associated data. 
While normally an iterator dereferences to the associated data, with 
a `void` type an iterator dereferences to the key,

* multiple equivalent elements are stored in the order they were inserted.
