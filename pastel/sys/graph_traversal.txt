Graph traversal
===============

[[Parent]]: graph_algorithms.txt

A _graph-traversal_ algorithm visits (exactly once) all those 
vertices ''V'' of a graph which are reachable from a given set of 
_seed_ vertices ''S subset V''. The order in which the vertices 
are visited depends on the specific algorithm. A generic description 
of the algorithm follows.

Generic algorithm
-----------------

If ''S'' is empty, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise the algorithm 
picks a vertex ''v in S'', visits it, and then adds all unvisited 
adjacent vertices of ''v'' to ''S''. This process is repeated until 
the algorithm terminates.

Algorithm objects
-----------------

A specific graph traversal algorithm is encapsulated by an 
[algorithm-object][Algorithm] implementing the `GraphTraversal_Algorithm` 
concept.
