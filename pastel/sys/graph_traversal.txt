Graph traversal
===============

[[Parent]]: graph_algorithms.txt

A _graph-traversal_ algorithm visits (exactly once) all those 
vertices ''V'' of a graph which are reachable from a given set of 
_seed_ vertices ''S subset V''. The order in which the vertices 
are visited depends on the specific algorithm. 

Algorithm objects
-----------------

A specific graph traversal algorithm is encapsulated by an 
[algorithm-object][Algorithm] implementing the `GraphTraversal` 
concept. An algorithm-object of this type can be executed by
the `traverseGraph()` function implemented in 
[[FileLink: generic_traversal.h]].
