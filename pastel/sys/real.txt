Real concept
============

Theory
------

A _field_ is a triple ''(F, +, *)'', where

 * ''(F, +)'' is a commutative group with the identity element ''0''.
 
 * ''(F, *)'' is a commutative monoid with the identity element ''1 != 0''.

 * ''(F\{0}, *)'' is a commutative group.
 
 * ''forall x, y, z in F: x * (y + z) = (x * y) + (x * z)''
 
Examples of fields include rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, and
finite fields. 
 
An _ordered field_ is a tuple ''((F, +, *), <=)'', where 

 * ''(F, +, *)'' is a field.

 * ''<='' is a total order relation in ''F''.
 
 * ''forall x, y, z in F: x <= y <=> x + z <= y + z''
 
 * ''forall x, y in F: 0 <= x and 0 <= y <=> 0 <= xy''
 
Examples of ordered fields include rational numbers and real numbers.

An _affinely extended ordered field_ is a tuple 
''((F union {-oo, +oo}, +, *), <=)'', where
 
* ''-oo'' and ''oo'' are called minus-infinity and plus-infinity,
respectively.

* ''((F, +, *), <=)'' is an ordered field.

* ''-oo = -(+oo)''

* ''forall x in F: -oo <= x and x <= +oo''

* ''forall x in F: oo +- x = x +- oo = +-oo''

* ''forall x in F: (+-oo) * x = x * (+-oo) = signum(x) * (+-oo)''

* ''forall x in F: x / (+-oo) = 0''

* ''forall x in F: (+-oo) / x = signum(x) * (+-oo)''
 
Such an extended field is not a field. For example, the
infinities do not have an inverse element. Most often the significance
of the infinities is that they allow for compact notation, as used for 
infinite real intervals and unbounded limiting behaviour of functions.
 
Practice
--------

The Real concept abstracts elements of an affinely extended ordered field. 
Specifically, by this abstraction we aim to capture implementations of 
floating point numbers and rational numbers. The intent is to be able to use the
same algorithms independent of the representation of numbers. For example,
the same geometric algorithms may be used with either floating point
arithmetic or exact rational arithmetic.
