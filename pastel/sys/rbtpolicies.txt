RbtPolicy concept
=================

[[Parent]]: redblacktree.txt

The RbtPolicy concept allows to modify the behaviour of the RedBlackTree.
First, it allows you to specify the type of the value data to
store in each node. Second, it allows you to update value data 
automatically as the tree structure changes, to allow for hierarchical
data. This generic augmentation of the red-black tree allows for 
developing a large class of tree-based algorithms.
