Skip list notes
===============

[[Parent]]: skiplist.txt

This section contains notes on the implementation of the skip-list
in Pastel. It helps to understand the corresponding code.

We implement the deterministic 1-2-skip-list, using the array-implementation. From now on, we will refer to this variant as a skip-list.

Equivalent elements
-------------------

We allow the skip-list to contain equivalent elements,
i.e. keys x and y such that !(x < y) and !(y < x).
This divides the set of elements in the skip-list
into equivalence classes. We let the first element 
of each equivalence class work as a representative.

### Leveling

To avoid degrading the performance of the skip-list
because of equivalent elements, we will organize the
levels of the skip-list as follows:

* Level 0: All elements, called the _basic_ level.
* Level 1: All representatives.
* Level n > 1: A subset of the elements in the level (n - 1),

We call the levels > 0 _skip_ levels. The idea is that
whenever a search is done for an element, the interest
is always on the first or the last matching element.
When the non-representatives are linked only on the 
basic level, they are invisible to the skip-levels,
and thus we are able to search exclusively in the set
of representatives.

### Equivalence classes

When a given search is started from a non-representative,
we need a way to obtain the representative of its
equivalence class in constant time. We could store a link
to the representative with each element. However, this
would lead to linear complexity updates when a 
representative is removed from the skip-list. To avoid 
this, we represent the equivalence classes explicitly.
Each equivalence class points to its representative, 
and each element points to its equivalence class. Thus
when a representative is removed, we may simply replace
the representative pointer in the equivalence class.

Skip-link storage
-----------------

* We will use the array-implementation of the skip-list. The 
array-implementation takes less memory than the linked-list 
implementation because it need not store the vertical pointers.

* Each node stores the skip-links for every level of its height
in an array, as well as the height of the node.

* The physical size of the link-array is always the logical height 
of the node rounded up to the next power of two, so it need not
be stored. Growing the physical size exponentially is also needed to achieve logarithmic updates.

* We do not store the link-array in an `std::vector`, because it
also stores the physical size. 

* It is fast to find out the next power of two. But it is even faster
to test if an integer is a power of two. It is sufficient to use the
the latter exclusively; when the logical size hits a power of two,
the next physical size is the double of this.

[[CppCode]]:
	bool isPowerOfTwo(integer that)
    {
        return (that & (that - 1)) == 0;
    }

Alternating skip-lists
----------------------

* An alternating skip-list is an implementation strategy where every skip-link is unidirectional, but alternates at every level.

* Alternation saves memory (by a constant) over bidirectional linking, but sacrifices efficiency (by a constant) in finger searches.

* We do not implement alternation because we favor finger-search efficiency over memory use.

Insertion
---------

* Inserting a node may require several skip-link arrays to be 
reallocated to greater physical sizes.

* To guarantee strong exception safety, a skip-link array of every
height of the form 2^i, up to the current maximum, is allocated 
before the insertion, and these are then used when required.

* When rebalancing, a link-set may be replaced by a bigger
link-set. In this case the old link-set is put pack in the
pre-allocation set, rather than deleted.

Insertion algorithm
-------------------

* Find the correct place to insert the new element.

* If the insertion results in 3 subsequent elements with the same 
level, raise the level of the middle one, and recurse to rebalance
the middle element, repeatedly raising the middle of 3 subsequent
elements with the same level.

Removal
-------

Removal from a skip-list works as follows:

* If the element is not of height 2, pass its link-set to its successor or predecessor, whichever is present.

* Remove the node.

* Let n = 2.

* If an element of height n is present, then we are done.

* Otherwise, there must be an element with height n + 1, which we shorten to height n.

* If there are now three subsequent elements of height n, raise the middle one, and we are done.

* Otherwise, the shortening may have removed the only element of height n + 1. Repeat the previous with height n + 1.
