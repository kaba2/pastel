As_Pair concept map
===================

[[Parent]]: undocumented.txt

Pairs of objects occur repeatedly in programming, most often
to denote 2d coordinates, an association between two objects,
or simply a logical grouping. Since it is such a fundamental
data structure, and because it is also something to which 
many data structures simplify to, a pair of objects can be 
found in various guises even inside the same library. In
Pastel, a pair can be given as a `std::pair`, a
`KeyValue`, or a `Tuple`. Thus a concept map is needed to map
the syntactically different types to a uniform concept.
This concept map is called the `As_Pair`.
