An _indicator function_ is a function ''f : S --> {0, 1}'', where 
''S'' is a set. Indicator functions can be thought to represent the
subset of ''S'' given by the preimage of 1. An _indicator_ is any
callable object in C++, which takes in a single argument,
and returns a boolean. Indicators are used in Pastel to filter out
candidates, for example in nearest neighbors searching, where it
is often desirable to ignore the searched point itself.
