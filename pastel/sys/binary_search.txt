Binary search
=============

[[Parent]]: algorithms.txt

The _binary search_ is an algorithm for locating the boundary between two subsequent disjoint integer intervals ''A, B subset ZZ'', when one is only able to query whether a given point ''i in A cup B'' is in ''A'' or not. The algoritm works in ''O(f log(|A cup B| + 2))'' time, where ''O(f)'' is the time taken by a single query.

The _exponential binary search_ solves the same problem as the binary search with an improved time complexity of ''O(f log(|A| + 2))''.
