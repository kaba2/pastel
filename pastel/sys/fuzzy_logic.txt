Fuzzy logic
===========

[[Parent]]: basic_math.txt

Sometimes it is required to answer a question with not only
true or false, but also with 'both' or 'neither' or
some other choice. For example, the sign of a variable has
three states: the sign might be negative, positive, or the 
variable might be zero, that is, not negative nor positive.
The logic functions are generalized to these tri-states,
with false being 0, true being 1, and values not true
or false being 0.5. The used t-norm is max.
