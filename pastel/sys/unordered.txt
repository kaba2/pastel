Unordered associative containers

Theory
------

Hashing is a technique which allows in many practical
cases for constant-time associative searches.
The unordered containers in Pastel are based on hashing
and implement the TR1 library proposals for the hash-based
containers in the C++ Standard Library. When the elements
can be hashed, and the storage order does not matter, 
it is preferable to use these unordered containers instead 
of the std::set and std::map.

UnorderedMap and UnorderedSet containers.
