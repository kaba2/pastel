Hash tables
===========

Theory
------

_Hashing_ is a technique which allows for constant-time associative 
searches in many practical cases. The unordered containers in Pastel 
are based on hashing and implement, except for a differing 
[allocator model][Allocator], the TR1 library proposals for the 
hash-based containers in the C++ Standard Library. When the elements 
can be hashed, and the storage order does not matter, it is preferable 
to use these unordered containers instead of the `std::set` and `std::map`.

_Petri Lehtinen_ implemented both of the `UnorderedMap` and 
`UnorderedSet` containers.
