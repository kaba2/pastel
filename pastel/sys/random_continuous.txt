Continuous random variables
===========================

[[Parent]]: random.txt

Pastel allows to generate random real numbers from a number of
useful distributions. For each distribution Pastel provides its 
probability density function and the ability to generate vectors 
of random numbers. If a parameter corresponds to a simple
translation of the random variable, the parameter is not 
included because it can be trivially added by the user. 
This simplifies the interface.
