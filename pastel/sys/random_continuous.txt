Continuous random variables
===========================

[[Parent]]: random.txt

Pastel allows to generate random real numbers from a range of
useful distributions. These include:

 * Uniform in [0, 1], ]0, 1], [0, 1[, and ]0, 1[.
 * Triangle
 * Gaussian
 * Generalized Gaussian
 * Log-Normal
 * Exponential
 * Laplace
 * Gamma
 * Beta
 * Dirichlet
 * Cauchy
 * Chi-squared

For each distribution Pastel also provides its probability 
density function and the ability to generate vectors of
random numbers. If a parameter corresponds to a simple
translation of the random variable, the parameter is not 
included because it can be trivially added by the user. 
This simplifies the interface.
