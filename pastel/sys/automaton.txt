Finite-state automaton
======================

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

The `Automaton` is a data structure for storing and manipulating 
finite-state automata.

Definitions
-----------

A _finite-state automaton_ is a finite labeled directed [graph][Graph]
with vertices ''Q'', called the _states_, and ''Sigma''-labeled 
edges 'T', called the _transitions_, together with a set of _start_ 
states ''S subset Q'', and a set of _final_ states ''F subset Q''.

A slightly weaker, but more traditional, definition is the following.
A _finite-state_ automaton is a tuple ''(Q, Sigma, S, delta, F)'',
where ''Q'' and ''Sigma'' are finite sets, called the _states_ and 
the _symbols_, respectively, ''S subset Q'' and ''F subset Q'' are 
finite sets, called the _start states_ and the _final states_, 
respectively, and ''delta : (S times Sigma) --> power-set(Q)'' is a
function, called the _transition function_.

The difference between these definitions is that the former definition
allows for multiple transitions between two states with the same symbol,
while the latter does not.

A finite-state automaton is called _deterministic_ if and only if
a transition from a state ''q'' with a symbol ''s'' always leads to
the same state p (this definition allows multiple such transitions).

Data structure
--------------

The data structure underlying the automaton is the 
[[Link: incidence_graph.txt]]; the automaton has all the 
properties that the `IncidenceGraph` has. What the automaton
data structure layers on top of this is that it stores the 
set of start and the final states, and also makes this 
information available through a state. An important part of
the design is that automata can be merged in constant time
to yield the (non-deterministic) automaton recognizing the
union of the languages recognized by the automata. By some
additional modification of this automaton, one can form the 
sequence-, optional-, and repetition-automata (etc.) used 
to form automata from regular expressions.
