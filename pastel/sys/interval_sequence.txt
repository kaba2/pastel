Interval sequences
==================

[[Parent]]: maths.txt

An _interval sequence_ is a finite even-length sequence of a strictly weak ordered set ''X''. Subsequent pairs of this sequence are called _intervals_. Each interval ''(a, b)'' represents the set ''{x in X : a <= x < b}''. The interval sequence represents the union of its intervals. Note that an interval is empty whenever ''b <= a'', but still well-defined. Sometimes it is useful to restrict to non-decreasing interval sequences, so that union, intersection, and difference, of interval sequences, can be computed efficiently.

History
-------

The motivation for this concept was originally to represent a sliding window over a time-series when using the [PointKdTree][]. When the window was moved, only the symmetric difference between the old window and the new window needed to be updated. Since the window needed to be of such a shape that the center of the window needed to be excluded, something more general was needed rather than just intervals. This assumed a non-decreasing interval sequence.

The interval sequences are also used in the query algorithms for the [temporal kd-tree][TdTree], to represent the time-subset over which the query is made. Here there are no restrictions for the interval sequences.
