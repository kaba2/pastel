Interval sequences
==================

[[Parent]]: maths.txt

An _interval sequence_ is a non-decreasing finite even-length sequence 
of a totally ordered set ''X''. Subsequent pairs of this sequence are 
called _intervals_. Each interval ''(a, b)'' represents the set 
''{x in X : a <= x < b}''. The interval sequence represents the union
of its intervals.

An interval sequence is useful because it can be used to represent
arbitrary subsets of a totally ordered set, and because there exists 
efficient algorithms for computing set-operations between interval 
sequences (such as difference, union, and intersection). 

History
-------

The motivation for this data structure was originally to represent a 
sliding window over a time-series. When the window was moved, only the 
symmetric difference between the old window and the new window needed 
to be updated. Since the window needed to be of such a shape that the 
center of the window needed to be excluded, something more general
was needed rather than just intervals.
