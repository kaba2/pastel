PoolAllocator class
===================

[[Parent]]: allocators.txt

The `PoolAllocator` is a memory allocator for memory regions of
uniform size. This allows for minimal book-keeping and very fast 
allocation and deallocation. The basic approach is based on 
allocating big blocks of memory which is then shared as required. 
`PoolAllocator` is _conservative_ in memory allocation: no new 
memory is allocated until all existing memory is used.

I first saw the idea of embedding the linked list inside the memory 
block in the book _Modern C++ Design_ by Andrei Alexandrescu. He
discusses the implementation of a similar memory allocator.
