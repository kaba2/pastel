PoolAllocator class

Practice
--------

In situations where dynamic allocation and deallocation
of small objects is frequent and large scale, the performance
of the native allocator can often be enhanced substantially in some
restricted cases. One such case is where the size of the allocated
objects is constant. This allows for minimal book-keeping and very 
fast allocation and deallocation. The basic approach is based on
allocating big blocks of memory which is then shared as required.
PoolAllocator only allocates raw memory, construction and destruction 
of objects is left to the user of the memory.

PoolAllocator allows to deallocate memory. PoolAllocator is conservative 
in memory allocation: no new memory is allocated until all existing 
memory is used.
