Pseudorandom number generator
-----------------------------

_Mersenne Twister_ is a fast, high-quality pseudo-random number generator with a period of ''2^19937 - 1''. Because of these properties, many libraries have chosen it as the default random number generator, including Matlab and Python's standard library. It is also the choice in Pastel where it is used to generate pseudo-random integers.
