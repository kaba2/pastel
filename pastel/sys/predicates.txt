Predicates
==========

[[Parent]]: algorithm_objects.txt

The _predicate_ concept is a refinement of the algorithm concept.
It requires additionally that the algorithm takes two arbitrary 
arguments and returns a boolean result.

Example
-------

Sorting is usually carried out something like this:

[[CppCode]]:
	std::sort(begin, end, std::greater<int>());
	
With predicates we write this:

[[CppCode]]:
	std::sort(begin, end, GreaterThan());
