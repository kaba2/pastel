A _logger_ is an object which can be attached to [log objects][Log].
The log objects distribute textual data to loggers, which then
store or report this data in various ways. Perhaps the most 
common usages are outputting to screen or a file. All loggers derive
from the `Logger` abstract base class, allowing to define additional
types of loggers when needed.
