Breadth-first traversal
=======================

[[Parent]]: graph_algorithms.txt

The _breadth-first traversal_ is an algorithm for traversing the 
vertices of a graph. The algorithm first pushes all the _seed_ vertices
to a queue. As long as there is a vertex ''v'' at the front of the queue, 
the algorithm marks ''v'' as traversed, reports ''v'', removes ''v'' from 
the queue, and then pushes all the untraversed adjacent vertices of ''v'' 
at the back of the queue.
