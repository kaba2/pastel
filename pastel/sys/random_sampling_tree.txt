Random sampling tree
====================

[[Parent]]: random_discrete.txt

The _random sampling tree_ is an [augmented red-black tree][RedBlack],
which allows fast generation of random variates from an arbitrary 
discrete probability distribution. Because of the used data structure,
the distribution can be changed dynamically and efficiently.

Time complexity
---------------

The data structure inherits the performance guarantees of the red-black
tree. In addition, a random variate can be generated from the described
probability distribution in time `Theta(log n)`, where `n` is the number 
of different outcomes.

Nodes
-----

The nodes of the tree are key-value pairs, where the key is the mass, 
and the value is user-defined data:

[[CppCode]]:
	RedBlackTree<KeyValue<Real, Data>, Pastel::LessThan,
		RandomSamplingTree_RbtPolicy<Real> >
		
The probability mass of a given node is given by its mass divided by 
the total mass of all nodes. Value-data is used to keep track of the
total mass under the subtree rooted at each node. It is this total
mass of subtrees which allows for the fast generation of random deviates.
