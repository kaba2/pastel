Small associative containers
============================

Practice
--------

Binary trees and hash-based containers provide excellent
performance for associative searches and are appropriate most
of the time. However, when the number of stored elements is 
low, say less than 64, it is more efficient both in time 
and storage to simply use an array to store the elements of 
an associative container. By making sure the elements of
the array are sorted at all times, the searches on it are
logarithmic. Because of this sorting invariant, the insertions
and removals are linear time operations. However, because
of the low number of elements and good locality of reference, 
these are still fast operations in practice.

For this purpose, Pastel provides the _small associative containers_
SmallSet, SmallMap, and SmallFixedSet.
