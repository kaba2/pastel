Reporter concept
================

[[Parent]]: generic_programming.txt

A _reporter_ is any object which can be called like a function and
passed another object as an argument. In generic functions it works
as an abstraction for transmitting a sequence of unspecified length
back to the caller.

In C++ STL, _output iterators_ are used to transmit sequences 
generically out of functions. However, output iterators have a lot
of extraneous functionality which is not essential to the task.
For example, its position, or the requirement that to report 
something through an iterator, it needs to be dereferenced.
This is in contradiction to the goal of generic programming, that 
algorithms should work at a maximally wide range of types while 
minimizing requirements.
