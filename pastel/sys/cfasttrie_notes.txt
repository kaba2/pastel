How should bundles be stored?
-----------------------------

* An empty element-set must be stored somewhere, so that its end-node can act as the global end-node.
* Given a bundle, it must be possible to tell whether the previous or the next bundle exists.

### Option 1: std::list

* Create two empty bundles, the first one, and the last one.
* The element-set of the last bundle contains the global end-node.
