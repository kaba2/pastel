Ranges
======

[[Parent]]: generic_programming.txt

A _range_ is a sequence of elements of some specific type. 

Theory
------

The elements of a range are said to be _in the range_. A _forward range_ 
is a range whose first element can be accessed, and which can reduce itself 
to refer to all elements, except the first. A _bidirectional range_ is a 
forward range whose last element can be accessed, and which can reduce 
itself to refer to all elements, except the last. A _random-access range_ 
is a bidirectional range whose n:th element can be accessed.

The first and last elements of a range are guaranteed to exist as long 
as they are in the range. Actual range implementations may give
additional persistence guarantees.

If a range contains no elements, then it is called _empty_. Every range
can be queried for emptiness. The _size of a range_ is the number of
elements in the range. A size of zero is equivalent to emptiness.

If a range is infinite, or finite but of unknown size, then the size is 
defined as -1.

I first saw the range concept, as described here, in a presentation 
_Iterators Must Go_, by Andrei Alexandrescu, given at BoostCon 2009.
