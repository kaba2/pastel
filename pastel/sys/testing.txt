### ENSURE, ASSERT, and REPORT

These are runtime checks to check for invariants.
ENSURE's catch precondition violations
(e.g. user passes a parameter that is out of range).
ASSERT's catch bugs in the inner implementations.
REPORT is simply used to generate report with
the same kind of output as with ENSURE and ASSERT
but without aborting the program.
