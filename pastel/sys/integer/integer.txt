Fixed-size integers
===================

[[Parent]]: integers.txt

The `Integer` class is an integer whose number of bits can be set arbitrarily at compile-time. It works either as an unsigned integer, or as a signed integer in two's complement form, selectable at compile-time. For an unsigned integer the bit-representation is its base-2 representation. For an n-bit integer, the arithmetic is performed modulo ''2^n''. For a signed integer, the bit-representation is in two's complement form.
