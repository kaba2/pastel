Native integer
==============

[[Parent]]: integers.txt

The native integer type `integer` is an instance of the Integer concept.
The support for it is automatically included in [[FileLink: mytypes.h]].

### Infinity

The infinity for an `integer` is the greatest positive value it can hold.
For this value it holds that any number is either less than or equal to it.
The negation of infinity is _not_ the smallest value, but the next-smallest
value. However, this value should still be treated as the minus infinity: it
is more important to retain the property that the negation of infinity is
the minus infinity. The infinity and -infinity should be used whenever there
is a need to initialize variables with their semantics. The infinity is 
obtained with the `(integer)Infinity()` function.
