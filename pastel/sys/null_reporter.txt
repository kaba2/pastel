Null reporter
=============

[[Parent]]: reporters.txt

A _null reporter_ does not do anything with the reported object.
It forgets it, or sends it to an oblivion. This is useful when a
certain information is not of interest. Not only is this convenient,
but it also enables the compiler to possibly optimize away some 
portions of algorithms.
