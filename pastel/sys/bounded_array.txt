Bounded array
=============

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

A _bounded array_ is an array where the maximum number of elements is bounded by a compile-time constant. It works otherwise similarly to std::vector. The motivation for this data structure is to avoid memory allocations from the heap, when the number of stored elements is small.
