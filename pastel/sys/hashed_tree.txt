Hashed tree
===========

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

The _hashed tree_ is a red-black tree which has been customized to maintain 
the combined hash of the hashes of the elements in the subtree 
of each node. This tree has exactly the same properties as the red-black 
tree, with the added ability to provide the hash of its elements (the hash
of the root node) in constant time. This enables storing sets of elements
in a hash-table.
