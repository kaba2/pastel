Guid class

A _globally unique identifier_ is an algorithmically generated integer which is extremely probable to be unique among other integers generated by the same algorithm.

Theory
------

Sometimes things need to be given truly global identifiers, from which they can safely be identified later. In this case a need for an identifier allocation policy arises. If this identifier allocation process is distributed, it is impossible without coordination to avoid duplicate identifiers. This is solved by using a statistical approach instead, where a long identifier is combined together from time, place and environment-dependent variables. For example, a network mac-address should itself be a universally unique identifier. If we further pack with this information the current date and time and some random number we are pretty sure to never have any colliding identifiers. Such identifiers are called _Globally Unique IDentifiers_ (GUID).

Practice
--------

Pastel implements a class to store a 128-bit identifier along with some modification and comparison functions. The identifier itself needs to be generated by some dedicated program.
