Theory
------

It is often the case that some things may need to be given truly 
global identifiers, from which they can be safely identified later. 
In this case a need for an identifier allocation policy also arises.
If this identifier allocation process is distributed,
it is impossible without coordination to avoid duplicate
identifiers. This is solved by using a statistical approach where 
a long identifier is combined together from time, place and
environment dependent variables. For example, a network
mac address should itself be a universally unique identifier.
If we further pack with this information the current date
and time and some random number we are pretty sure to never
have any colliding identifiers. Such identifiers are called
`Globally Unique IDentifiers`.

Practice

Pastel implements a class to store a 128-bit identifier along with some
modification and comparison functions.
