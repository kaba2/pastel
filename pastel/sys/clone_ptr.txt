Cloning pointer
===============

[[Parent]]: memory.txt

The `ClonePtr` is a smart pointer which follows value semantics
for its pointee. The cloning, and deletion, procedure for the pointee 
can be provided by the user. The default cloning behaviour (given by a 
_cloner_) is as follows. If the pointee type contains a member 
function `clone()`, then that function is called to make a deep 
copy of the pointee. Otherwise the copy constructor is called to 
create the deep copy. The default deletion procedure (given by a 
_deleter_) is simply to call `delete`.
