Arbitrarily-sized integers
==========================

[[Parent]]: integer.txt

The `BigInteger` class implements arbitrarily-sized integers.
It dynamically changes its size depending on the contained number.
Compared to using native integers, using this number type is 
orders of magnitude slower. However, combined with the Rational 
class, one obtains exact arithmetic over the rationals.
