Linked list
===========

`FastList` is an almost-standards-conforming implementation of
the C++ Standard Library `std::list`. The only place where it
differs is in that of enhancing the [allocator support][Allocator].
To motivation was to make it possible to use the specialized
`PoolAllocator` in Pastel with the list, for enhanced memory
usage and performance. Unfortunately this is not possible with
the current allocator concept as defined in current C++98
standard.
