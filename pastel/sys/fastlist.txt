==============

Motivation
----------

_FastList_ is an almost-standards-conforming implementation of
the C++ Standard Library std::list. The only place where it
differs is in that of enhancing the allocator support.
To motivation was to make it possible to use the specialized
PoolAllocator in Pastel with the list, for enhanced memory
usage and performance. Unfortunately this is not possible with
the current allocator concept as defined in current C++98
standard.
