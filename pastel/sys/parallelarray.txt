Parallel array
==============

[[Parent]]: data_structures.txt

The `ParallelArray` is an implementation of a 'parallel array'. Rather 
than storing structs in an array, this data structure can be thought 
as storing arrays in a struct. For example, consider a struct consisting 
of a name and a phone number. Rather than storing these structs in an 
array, you store all of the names in one array, and all of the phone 
numbers in another array. The association between a name and a phone
number is given by the position in the array. The contained arrays are 
called _properties_.

The advantage of this structuring is that the fields or members of the 
struct can be added and removed dynamically. The types of the contained 
arrays can be arbitrary. Succesfully retrieving an array requires knowing 
its key and its precise type.

Resizing might result in the reallocation of the individual
array memories. In this case all references to those
arrays are invalidated.
