Vector design notes

What concept should the Type model?
-----------------------------------

### Vectors in ''ZZ^n''

First of all, we abuse terminology here. By vectors in ''ZZ^n''
we actually mean elements of a module over ''ZZ''.
If the scalars are ''ZZ'', then we have module elements,
if the scalars are ''RR'', then we have vectors.
We don't want to implement Vectors separately
for the modules because they would be identical to the Vector implementation.
Thus we embed them into the existing Vector class.
We need to separate those functions that only require
the scalar set to be an ordered ring and those that require
the scalar set to be ''RR''. Note the use of an ordered ring rather ''ZZ''
to underline that the functions should work for ''RR'' too.

Rejected ideas

### Vector is-a Tuple 

It should be possible to pass a vector to a
function requiring a tuple:

[[CppCode]]:
	template <typename Type, integer N>
	void f(const Tuple<N, Type>& left)
	{
		//...
	}

	Vector<float> a;
	f(a);

It is essential that the Tuple be a base-class
of Vector to make the template parameter
deduction to work. However, the use of expression templates 
also requires that a VectorExpression is a base class of
Vector. 

If we now use the obvious multiple inheritance to achieve
this hierarchy, then we increase the memory
cost by 4 bytes which is unacceptable for static
Vectors.

Could we convert the inheritance hierarchy to a linear one?
Clearly the Tuple can't be a base-class of
the VectorExpression because then every sub-expression
would take the Tuple's amount of extra memory
(which most of the time is not used at all).
So the question is if we should make
the VectorExpression a base-class of the Tuple?
The answer is no because that would not make sense when 
then Tuple is used on its own.

Thus it seems this requirement can't be satisfied.
