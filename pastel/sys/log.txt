Logging

_Logging_ is about reporting essential state of the program at runtime.
It is important when trying to solve problems that are external to
the program. Prime examples are when a file can not be found or can't
be opened for some reason. Examining logs can reveal such problems.

The places where the logging information should be sent changes depending
on the situation. In addition, there should not be a single log, but multiple
logs which are used as needed. To address the latter need, in Pastel logs can 
be created as objects. To address the former need, these logs can be attached
so-called _loggers_ at run-time. These loggers do the actual logging, such
as writing to a file, or a stream.
