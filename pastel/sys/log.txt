Logging

Motivation
----------

Logging is about reporting essential state of the program at runtime.
It is important when trying to solve problems that are external to
the program. Prime examples are when a file can not be found or can't
be opened for some reason. Examining logs can reveal such problems.

The places where the logging information should be sent changes depending
on the situation. In addition, there should not be a single log, but multiple
logs which are used as needed. To address the latter need, in Pastel logs can 
be created as objects. To address the former need, these logs can be attached
so-called observers at run-time. Such observers include ones that write to a
file, to a stream, or to a C output (via printf). Since these observers
follow an abstract interface through the LogObserver class, new
observer classes can be written as needed.
