Theory
------

A _rectangle_ ''S'' in ''ZZ^n'' is a Cartesian product of 
''n'' half-open intervals. Alternatively, it is described by two points ''A'' 
and ''B'' in ''ZZ^n'', such that 

''S = {x in RR^n | \forall i in [1, n] : A_i <= x_i < B_i}''.

In this representation, ''A'' is called the _minimum point_, and 
''B'' is called the _maximum point_.

Practice
--------

In Pastel, a rectangle is modeled with the `AlignedBox<integer, N>` 
class using the min-max representation. The minimum point and the 
maximum point are initialized to [`infinity\<integer\>()`][NativeInteger], 
and `-infinity\<integer\>()`, respectively, to represent an empty rectangle.
The same class template is used to represent axis-aligned boxes in ''RR^n'',
by providing a type modeling the [Real][Real] concept. The PastelGeometry 
library takes [this view further][GeometryBox].
