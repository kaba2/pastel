Object forwarding
=================

[[Parent]]: generic_programming.txt

_Object forwarding_ is a technique in which an object is contained as 
a member of another object, and where all the operations on the containing
object are forwarded to the contained object. The purpose of this 
technique is to be able to "derive classes from native types", such as 
`int`. This in turn is useful in the implementation of data structures
which support embedding user-data in its parts. First, this automatically
makes use of the empty base-class optimization, so that memory use can
be completely avoided when user-data is not needed. Second, being able
to derive arbitrary types makes it possible to fuse several layers of 
user data and data-structure-specific data seamlessly together.
