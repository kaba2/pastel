IndexAllocator class
====================

[Parent]: miscellaneous.txt

Theory
------

Sometimes one needs to allocate integer identifiers in a
conservative manner. I.e. the identifiers are resources
which can be allocated and deallocated, and, if on allocation
there are two free identifiers, then the smaller of them
is returned. With a proper data structure, this can be
done quite efficiently.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the IndexAllocator class to allocate and 
deallocate integer identifiers conservatively. This 
allows to perform allocations in amortized logarithmic time,
and deallocations in logarithmic time.
