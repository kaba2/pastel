IndexAllocator class
====================

[[Parent]]: undocumented.txt

_IndexAllocator_ manages integer identifiers in a conservative manner. 
The identifiers are resources which can be allocated and deallocated, 
and, if on allocation there are two free identifiers, then the smaller 
of them is returned. With a proper data structure, this can be done 
quite efficiently: allocations work in amortized logarithmic time,
while deallocations work in logarithmic time.
