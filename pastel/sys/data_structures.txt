Data structures
===============

[[Parent]]: pastelsys.txt

This section contains implementations for a set of fundamental data structures. In addition to being the everyday tools of a programmer, they also form a set of building blocks from which to form more advanced data structures.

Basic properties
----------------

Every data structure in Pastel

* is [const-correct][Layered],
* is [exception-safe][Layered],
* follows the [open-closed principle][Layered],
* follows the [principle of minimal requirements and maximal information][Layered],
* follows the [zero overhead principle][ClassWrapping],
* uses [adaptable iterators][Adaptable],
* is [customizable][Customization],
* is documented for exception-safety,
* is documented for time-complexity, and
* is documented for space-complexity.
