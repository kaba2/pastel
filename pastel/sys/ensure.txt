Theory
------

In programming, an _invariant_ is a condition that must hold 
everytime the program executes through a specific position. 
In general, we can think of splitting up a program into
small blocks of functionality. Each such block promises to
do something, described by a set of _postconditions_, on the 
condition that the data it uses fulfills certain _preconditions_.
Here is a small example of computing the logarithm of 
a floating point number x:

	Precondition: x >= 0, y = x
	// Do a lot of numerical stuff to
	// obtain an approximation to log(x).
	Postcondition: x ~= log(y)

Most often, these blocks of code correspond to functions.
Then the preconditions are a set of requirements for the arguments
that are passed in, and the postconditions are a set of
effects that the function results in. However, more fine grained
checking is appropriate when the algorithm is complex.
While preconditions concern checking the arguments that the
user of the function passed in, those invariants internal
to a function concerns the correctness of the implementation.

Practice
--------

One important technique in lowering the number of bugs in a program 
is to establish and check invariants frequently. In less
fancy terms, this means to check that the program does what 
it promises to do. Arguably, the most important invariants
to check are the preconditions to functions.

Pastel provides three macros, ENSURE, PENSURE, and ASSERT, to help with
enforcing invariants. All of the three macros work in exactly the same way,
so we will demonstrate their functionality by taking ENSURE as an example.
The following demonstrates the use of ENSURE in an actual situation. 

	MatrixView& operator=(const MatrixView& that)
	{
		ENSURE2(width_ == that.width_, width_, that.width_);
		ENSURE2(height_ == that.height_, height_, that.height_);
		//...
	}	

ENSURE takes in a condition that must hold for the program to continue
execution beyond that point. The number 2 denotes that in case the
condition is not satisfied, we want to report the values of two variables
that are listed after the condition. Corresponding to the number of 
reported parameters, there are also ENSURE, ENSURE1, ENSURE2, ENSURE3, 
and ENSURE4. Triggering an ENSURE means that there is a bug at the _user's 
side_ (or a bug at the condition itself). To check for 
invariants inside an algorithm, see the ASSERT macro below.
	
Here our precondition is that the MatrixView's must have equal width and 
height when one is assigned into another. In case that
the conditions are satisfied, the program flow simply goes on
to execute the rest of the function. But if the conditions
are _not_ satisfied, then the following happens:

 1. The violated condition, file name, line number, and the parameters
 are printed into a log.
 
 2. The program is terminated via abort().

The reason for using a macro, which are well known for their 
disadvantages, is to be able to report the file name and 
line number, as well as the condition. Only the preprocessor can do
this, so the use of a macro is necessary. This is one of those rare
conditions where the use of a macro is justified.

ENSURE's are always present in the program and can't be removed
by conditional compilation from the program. This is to stress
the point that precondition checking is always important, also in
release versions. This is because in the case that a bug occurs, it is 
important to know about it. Furthermore, there is nothing you can 
do to save the situation after a bug has been detected because the
program state is corrupted.

This does bring up a problem with very short functions where the
invariant checking can induce a relatively big performance degradation
(for example, in checking the index bounds when accessing an array).
To solve this problem, Pastel offers the macro PENSURE, which stands
for "Performance ENSURE". This macro can be removed from the release
version of the program by conditional compilation.
It is intended to be used only in those rare situations where the 
cost of invariant checking is relatively too big. As a rule of thumb, 
I use PENSURE for functions that are of order O(log n) or less, and 
ENSURE for all others.

ASSERT is meant to be used to check invariants _inside_
an algorithm. Triggering an ASSERT means that there is a bug 
in the _implementation_ of the algorithm (or a bug
at the condition itself). ASSERT's, as PENSURE's, can be removed
by conditional compilation from the release version of the product.
