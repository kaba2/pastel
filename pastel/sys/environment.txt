Build switches
==============

[[Parent]]: building.txt

Pastel provides several build switches to control the code generation.
We explain these switches here. Note that these switches are essentially
enabled or disabled by the [configuration][Configuration] you use to 
build Pastel.

Global preprocessor switches
----------------------------

In the following we list the global preprocessor switches which 
should be defined at the level of the build-system, not at the source
code level.

### PASTEL\_DYNAMIC\_LIBRARIES

Pastel can be built into dynamic libraries instead of static libraries. 
If `PASTEL_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES` is defined, then, under Windows-based compilers, 
the `declspec(dllexport)` and `declspec(dllimport)` keywords are sprinkled all 
around the code.

Global type definitions
-----------------------

Pastel includes some global type definitions in the file [[FileLink: mytypes.h]],
which is included in practically every file in Pastel. In that file
there is particularly the definition of `real` type which you might
want to change to either `float` or `double` based on your specific
requirements.
