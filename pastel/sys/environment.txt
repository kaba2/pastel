Build switches
==============

[[Parent]]: building.txt

Pastel provides several build switches to control the code generation.
We explain these switches here.

Global preprocessor switches
----------------------------

In the following we list the global preprocessor switches which 
should be defined at the level of the build-system, not at the source
code level.

### PASTEL\_ENABLE\_PENSURES

`ENSURE`s are runtime checks used to [check preconditions][Ensure] for 
functions. The triggering of such a check signals the presence 
of a bug on the user's side.
However, some of these checks can cause relatively severe
performance degradation, notably when the function is of low complexity.
These checks are marked as `PENSURE`s, for _Performance `ENSURE`_.
This build switch controls the code generation for `PENSURE`s.
If `PASTEL_ENABLE_PENSURES` is defined, the tests are generated,
otherwise they are not.

### PASTEL\_DEBUG\_MODE

The `ASSERT`s form another class of runtime checks which are
used internally to check invariants in the Pastel library.
The triggering of such check always signals a presence of a bug
on the part of the implementation. They can possibly interfere 
with optimization and therefore this switch allows to control
whether their code is generated or not.
If `PASTEL_DEBUG_MODE` is defined, the tests are generated, 
otherwise they are not.

### PASTEL\_ENABLE\_OMP

Pastel uses the OpenMp library for parallelizing some sections
of the code, such as [all-nearest neighbors searching][Neighbors]. 
The OpenMp library comes with a header file omp.h, which however might not
always be available on a given building environment. To solve
this problem, Pastel has a redirection file named [[FileLink: pastelomp.h]],
which includes `omp.h` conditionally based on this build switch.
If `PASTEL_ENABLE_OMP` is defined, then `omp.h` is included in `pastelomp.h`,
otherwise it is not included.

Global type definitions
-----------------------

Pastel includes some global type definitions in the file [[FileLink: mytypes.h]],
which is included in practically every file in Pastel. In that file
there is particularly the definition of `real` type which you might
want to change to either `float` or `double` based on your specific
requirements. The other types should be chosen such that they meet
the obvious requirements (e.g. the size of `uint16` is 16 bits).
These requirements are checked automatically in [[FileLink: pastelsys.cpp]] in
the PastelSys library. Compilation of that file fails if the 
requirements are not met. In this case you might need to change the
types in [[FileLink: mytypes.h]] to proper types.
