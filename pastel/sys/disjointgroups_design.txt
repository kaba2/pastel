Disjoint sets design notes
==========================

[Parent]: disjointgroups.txt

Requirements
------------

1. Given an element A, determine its group.

2. Given two groups, form a new group as their union.

3. Create an empty group.

4. Add an element into a group.

5. Query the size of the group.

6. Traverse the elements of a group.

7. Remove a group.

8. Remove an element from a group.

9. Traverse all elements.

10. Traverse all groups.

x. Find a group by key. Not important, one can create a mapping from a key to an iterator afterwards.
