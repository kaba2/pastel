Depth-first traversal
=====================

[[Parent]]: graph_algorithms.txt

The _depth-first traversal_ is an algorithm for traversing the vertices
of a graph. The algorithm first pushes all the _seed_ vertices to a stack. 
As long as there is a vertex ''v'' at the back of the stack, the 
algorithm marks ''v'' as traversed, reports ''v'', removes ''v'' from 
the stack, and then pushes all the untraversed adjacent vertices of ''v'' 
at the back of the stack. This description parallels that for the 
breadth-first search. The traversal is commonly implemented by recursive 
function calls for efficiency; the stack is then implicit as the function 
call stack.
