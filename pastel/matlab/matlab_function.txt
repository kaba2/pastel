Multiple functions
==================

[[Parent]]: pastelmatlab.txt

There is only one entry point to a mex file, the `mexFunction`, which
transmits the passed-in arguments to the C++ side. From the maintenance
point of view, it is a bit problematic of having to create a separate
mex file for each function. Because each mex file needs to be linked
separately to form its own shared library, much code would then be
needlessly replicated. In addition, the build system would need to be
extended for each such library.

PastelMatlab solves these problems as follows. Multiple functions can 
be registered to be callable by associating a name with each. It defines
the `mexFunction` in such a way that the first parameter is assumed  to 
be a string, that specifies the actual function name to call inside the 
mex file. On call, PastelMatlab redirects to the correct function, with 
the remaining parameters transmitted as they are.
