Function registration
=====================

[[Parent]]: pastelmatlab.txt

There is only one entry point to a mex file, the `mexFunction`, which
transmits the passed-in arguments to the C++ side. 
To support multiple functions, PastelMatlab defines the `mexFunction` in 
such a way that the first parameter is assumed  to be a string which 
specifies the actual function name to call inside the mex file. On call, 
PastelMatlab redirects to the correct function, with the remaining 
parameters transmitted as they are. These functions are registered
callable by the functions found here.
