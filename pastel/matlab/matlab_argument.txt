Argument retrieval
==================

[[Parent]]: pastelmatlab.txt

Matlab type information is transmitted dynamically to C++ side.
PastelMatlab offers a set of functions to retrieve the arguments, 
and if needed, to do the necessary type conversions automatically. 
In the case that the types match, PastelMatlab references the 
already existing memory, rather than copies the data.
