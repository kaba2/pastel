Argument retrieval
==================

[[Parent]]: pastelmatlab.txt

One has to be careful when handling Matlab arguments in C++. This is
because the type information is given dynamically, and therefore can't 
directly be enforced by the compiler. PastelMatlab offers a set of 
functions to retrieve the arguments, and if needed, to do the necessary 
type conversions automatically. In the case that the types match, 
PastelMatlab references the already existing memory, rather than 
copying the data.
