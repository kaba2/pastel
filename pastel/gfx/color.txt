Theory
------

_Color_ is the visual sensation caused by radiomagnetic radiation 
in the 400nm-700nm wavelength range. Most humans have three kinds of receptors in the 
eye which are sensitive to different parts of the spectrum on sufficiently
high intensities (daytime), and one additional receptor which is 
active only at low intensities (night-time). This gives rise to the 
_trichromatic theory_ which  states that the space of all 
different colors is 3-dimensional. 

Practice
--------

Pastel implements conversions between color spaces,
conversions between integer-based color formats, and
other useful tools for working with colors.
Because of the trichromatic theory, a color is stored
in objects of type Color, which is simply a 3-component 
vector of type real32. The color space is not enforced by 
the type system, so the user must keep
in mind which color space a given color is from.
