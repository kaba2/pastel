Color

Theory
------

Color is the visual sensation caused by radiomagnetic radiation 
in the xxx-xxx wavelength range. Radiation with spectrum in this range
is also called light. Most humans have three kinds of receptors in the 
eye which are sensitive to different parts of the spectrum on sufficiently
high intensities (daytime), and one additional receptor which is 
active only at low intensities (night-time). This gives rise to the 
so-called trichromatic theory which  states that the space of all 
different colors is 3-dimensional. This theory is now most visibly 
applied in tv and computer monitors, where each pixel is composed 
of small closely positioned transmitters for red, green, and blue. 
Because of their approximity, the pixel is considered by
the brain as a single color which is not necessarily similar to
any of the transmitter colors.

### CIE-XYZ color space

One of the aims of color science is the description of color
in an objective manner. From this need was born the CIE-XYZ color
space, which relates each light spectrum with a real number 
triple (X, Y, Z). The theory states that if we pick an idealized
observer (an average human observer), then all different kinds of 
lights which map to the same (X, Y, Z)-triple gives the same visual sensation 
to the observer, no matter what the spectra are. This way CIE-XYZ color
space stands as an important link between the physical measurements 
of light and the visual sensations it causes.

### LMS color space

There is perhaps a more natural color space than the XYZ
from the physical point of view. This is the LMS color space 
which stands for Long-Medium-Short corresponding
to the types of wavelengths that the three receptors in the eye
are sensitive to. By knowing the response curves of these receptors
one can describe colors directly by their linear combinations which
is exactly what the LMS space is for.
The CIE-XYZ and the LMS space are related by a linear transformation. 
What is gained in this process is that the Y component corresponds to
the sensation of luminance (the sensed amplitude of light).
Additionally, the coordinate triples become positive.

### CIE-Lab color space

Another aim of color science is to deform the CIE-XYZ space in such
a way that the Euclidean distance between points corresponds to the
notion of similarity or dissimilarity of colors, as judged by a human.
A result of such an effort is the CIE-Lab color space, which is
an approximation to such a space.

### sRGB color space

For a long time the tv and computer monitors as well as the image 
formats did not follow any standard on the used color space (most
used RGB, but with unspecified transmitter responses). This caused 
an image produced using a specific monitor to look different on some other monitor 
(depending on how the transmitters were chosen etc). As a compromise
solution to this problem, the sRGB color space was defined whose
definition followed the properties of an average monitor at its 
time of definition. It has since been widely agreed that any image 
for which no color space is defined should be assumed to be in the sRGB
color space.
