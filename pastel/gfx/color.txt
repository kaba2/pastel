Theory
------

_Color_ is the visual sensation caused by radiomagnetic radiation 
in the 400nm-700nm wavelength range. Most humans have three kinds of receptors in the 
eye which are sensitive to different parts of the spectrum on sufficiently
high intensities (daytime), and one additional receptor which is 
active only at low intensities (night-time). This gives rise to the 
_trichromatic theory_ which  states that the space of all 
different colors is 3-dimensional.
