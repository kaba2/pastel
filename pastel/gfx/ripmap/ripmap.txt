Rip mapping
===========

[[Parent]]: precomputed_filtering.txt

A _rip-map_ is a set of images ''R = {R_s : s in [0, m_1] xx .. xx [0, m_n] sub ZZ^n}'', 
where for all ''s'':

 * ''R_s'' is a resampling of ''R_0''.

 * ''R_s'' has extents ''(2^(m_1 - s_1), ..., 2^(m_n - s_n))''. 

As an overload of terminology, each ''R_s'' is also called
a rip-map. The meaning of the term should be clear from the
context.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the `RipMap` class for storing and manipulating
rip-maps. It is declared as:

[[CppCode]]:
	template <typename Type, integer N = 2>
	class RipMap;

### Memory requirements

The memory requirements for a rip-map grow exponentially with
increasing dimension. In general, if an n-dimensional image 
takes ''C'' units of memory, then a rip-map takes ''C * 2^n''
units of memory.

### Example

Here is an example of a rip-map for a 2-dimensional image.
The invidual rip-maps have been combined into a single image
for visualization. Note: this image was originally 1024 x 1024,
which I resampled to 512 x 512 to better fit the webpage.
