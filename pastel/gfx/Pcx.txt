PCX file format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A PCX file contains a single image. 
It supports 1 bit, 2 bit, 4 bit and 8 bit indexed images as
well as 24-bit rgb images.
There are two possible palettes for indexed images in a pcx file:
the 16 color palette in the header, which is used for the indexed images
with <= 4 bits. For the 8 bit indexed images, there can be a 
separate 256 color palette of which presence can be detected from the 
header information. If there is a 256 color palette it is located at
the end of the file.

A 'scanline' contains the information for a one row of the image. 
A 'color plane' represents a single component of an image. Indexed images
have only one color plane, but the 24-bit rgb images have three:
red, green and blue.
Multiple color planes are stored successively inside
the scanline (first the whole row of red, then green, then blue).
Each 'color plane scanline' must take an even number of bytes and
so there might be a 'junk byte' at the end of each.

Each scanline is stored run length encoded in the following manner:
Read one byte. If the two most significant bits are set, then then
lower six bits give the repetition count for the data that is found
from the next byte. Otherwise the data represents itself. There is 
an encoding break after each scanline, but there are no
encoding breaks between color planes in a scanline.

PCX file format
---------------

The header has a fixed size of 128 bytes and looks like
this:

Offset  Type        Description
-------------------------------
0000h   byte        Manufacturer.
					10=ZSoft
0001h   byte        Version information
					0=PC Paintbrush v2.5
					2=PC Paintbrush v2.8 w palette information
					3=PC Paintbrush v2.8 w/o palette information
					4=PC Paintbrush/Windows
					5=PC Paintbrush v3.0+
0002h   byte        Encoding scheme, 1 = RLE, none other known
0003h   byte        Bits per pixel
0004h   word        Left margin of image
0006h   word        Upper margin of image
0008h   word        Right margin of image
000Ah   word        Lower margin of image
000Ch   word        Horizontal DPI resolution
000Eh   word        Vertical DPI resolution
0010h   48 byte     Color palette for indexed images with <= 4 bits per pixel
					16 RGB triplets
0040h   byte        reserved
0041h   byte        Number of color planes
					="NCP"
0042h   word        Number of bytes per scanline (always even,
					use instead of right margin-left margin).
					="NBS"
0044h   word        Palette information
					1=color/bw palette
					2=grayscale image
0046h   word        Horizontal screen size
0048h   word        Vertical screen size
004Ah   54 byte     Reserved, set to 0

0x80h               Image data

The  space needed to decode a single scan line is
NCP * NBS bytes, the last byte may be a junk byte
which is not displayed.

VGA palette
-----------

After the image data, if the version number is 5 (or greater?) there
possibly is a VGA color palette. The color ranges from 0 to 255, 0 is
zero intensity, 255 is full intensity. The palette has the following
format:

OFFSET              Count Type   Description
0000h                   1 byte   VGA palette integer (=0Ch)
0001h                 768 byte   RGB triplets with palette information
