Color palettes
==============

Theory
------

When only a relative few colors are needed, an effective way to save 
on storage costs is to store the needed colors in a table, and then
refer to them using small integers. Such a color system is called
_indexed_, and the array holding the colors is called a _palette_
(in reference to arts). Back in the early days of computer graphics
memory space was in premium, necessitating the use of an indexed
color system. While the first system allowed only 2 colors (monochrome), 
the later systems allowed subsequentially larger palettes
to be used: 4 (CGA standard), 16 (EGA standard), and finally 256 
(VGA standard). These numbers of colors correspond to 2, 4, and 8 bits 
for the size of the indexing integer.

Nowadays color indexing is primarily of interest in the hopes of creating
image files of small size when there are only a few colors. Otherwise
direct description of colors in sRGB color space are used, both in
image file formats and graphics hardware.

Practice
--------

Pastel provides functions to create some commonly needed palettes
when working with indexed images. These include a random palette, 
a grayscale palette, false color palettes, and, primarily for 
good memories, the default VGA palette:)
