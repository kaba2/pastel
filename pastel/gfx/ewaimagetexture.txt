Abstract
--------

This paper discusses the Elliptically Weighted Average (EWA) filtering algorithm along
with enhancements that further increase image quality. 
We derive all the mathematical results that are needed in the algorithm and
generalize the algorithm as follows. 
First, we allow filters with varying radii of support. Second, we propose a technique to embed differing
filters for the minification and magnification. This enhances the
image quality by allowing to use those filters in reconstruction that
are good in it (e.g. Lanczos filter with radius 2) and to use those filters in antialiasing that
avoid aliasing (e.g. Gaussian filter). The transition between these filters
is made invisible by linearly interpolating between the filters. The original
EWA algorithm is recovered by setting both filters to a Gaussian filter with radius 1.
Third, our derivations are coordinate-free which we believe is the best representation for the formulae
in the algorithm. This also enables generalizing the algorithm to higher dimensions 
(e.g. filtering voxel data in 3d), although this would be very costly.
We shall demonstrate that using a filter radius of 1 for the gaussian filter as in the original
EWA filtering algorithm leads to artifacts when magnifying.

Since it can be hard to see from the paper which pixels are there in purpose and
which are due to Adobe Acrobat resizing, I have included all the images in this webpage
in their original size.
