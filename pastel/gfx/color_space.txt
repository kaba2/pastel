An _absolute color space_ assigns a triple of real numbers to each 
spectrum of light.

Theory
------

### CIE-XYZ color space

The _CIE-XYZ color space_ assigns each light spectrum a real 
number triple (X, Y, Z). This mapping has been constructed such that
if we pick an idealized observer (an average human observer), then all
spectra which map to the same (X, Y, Z)-triple gives the same visual sensation 
to the observer (assuming the same viewing conditions). Spectra which
have an equal visual sensation are called _metamers_. The Y component
corresponds to the sensation of luminance (the intensity of light).
Note that luminance is linear to physical intensity of light, not to
the perceived intensity.

### LMS color space

The _LMS color space_ is perhaps a more natural color space than the CIE-XYZ
from the physical point of view. The LMS is an acronym of
Long-Medium-Short corresponding to the types of wavelengths that 
the three receptors in the eye are sensitive to. By knowing the response 
curves of these receptors one can describe colors directly by their linear 
combinations. This is exactly what the LMS coordinates are for. 
The CIE-XYZ and the LMS space are related by an invertible linear transformation.
This explains the ability of the CIE-XYZ space to identify metamers.
This linear transformation has been chosen such that the Y component corresponds to
luminance and that all of the coordinate triples are positive.

### CIE-Lab color space

The _CIE-Lab color space_ is a deformation of the CIE-XYZ space in such
a way that the Euclidean distance between points corresponds roughly to the
perceived similarity between colors, as judged by a human.
In addition, one of the components is lightness which grows roughly
linearly with the perceived intensity of the color. In this space

 * _Lightness_ is given by L. 
 
 * _Hue_ is given by ''h = atan2(b, a)''.

 * _Chroma_ is given by ''c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)''. 
 
 * _Saturation_ is given by ''s = c / L''.
 
### CIE-Lch color space

The _CIE-Lch color space_ are the cylindrical coordinates of the
CIE-Lab space. In this space

 * _Lightness_ is given by L.
 
 * _Hue_ is given by h.
 
 * _Chroma_ is given by c.

 * _Saturation_ is given by ''s = c / L''.
 
### sRGB color space

For a long time computer monitors and image formats did not 
follow any standard on the used color space. This resulted
in the images looking different depending on the 
monitor because the transmitters had different spectra. 
The _sRGB color space_ was proposed and widely adopted as a 
default color space for such images. If an image does not 
specify a color space, then it is assumed to be in sRGB.

The coordinates of the sRGB color space are gamma encoded,
i.e. in a form ready to be sent to the monitor.
The sRGB coordinates whose gamma encoding has been undone
are called _linear sRGB coordinates_. These linear coordinates
are related by a linear transformation to the CIE-XYZ space.

### HSV color space

The _HSV color space_ is a deformation of the sRGB color space.
It is an acronym of Hue-Saturation-Value. While the terms
suggest a basis in color science, this is not the case and the
deformation has been defined more as an aid to choosing colors.
Qualitatively, the parameters act as their counterparts in
color science.

The following image shows a slice through the HSV space with
constant value.

The saturation varies along the y-axis from the
bottom 0 to top 1. The hue varies along the x-axis from the
left 0 to top 1._

Practice
--------

Pastel provides functions to convert between:

 * CIE-XYZ and sRGB
 * CIE-XYZ and CIE-Lab
 * CIE-XYZ and CIE-xyY
 * CIE-XYZ and LMS
 * CIE-Lab and CIE-Lch
 * sRGB and HSV
