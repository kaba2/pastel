Adapted arrays
--------------

* Should cursors work with adapted arrays?

1) Make a new class, AdaptedArray, that
is derived from Array. The Array
represents the physical view, while
the AdaptedArray represents the adapted view.

AdaptedArray<2, uint32, Color, Rgb0888Adapter> image;

resample(image, ...);

* resample
* load/save pcx
* clear

image(x, y) *= t + 2;
