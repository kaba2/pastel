Radial texture
==============

[[Parent]]: distortion_textures.txt

The radial texture distorts a piece of an n-ball to an axis aligned box.
This distortion is described by the center of the ball and
a piece of that ball bounded by an aligned box in spherical 
coordinates. 

Example
-------

The images below demonstrate the usage. Note that
in the images below we have also applied a transform-texture
to flip and mirror the roles of x and y.

_The input image to be distorted as well as the piece of
the distortion ball._

_The result of applying the radial texture distortion. We
used mirroring for the texture extension and EWA filtering
for the image resampling._
