Theory
------

An _ideal noise function_ is any function ''f : RR^n -> [-1, 1] sub RR'' which fulfills the
following requirements:

 * ''f'' is at least twice differentiable (and thus continuous).
 
 * ''f'' is band-limited. I.e. the fourier transform of ''f'' has finite support.
 
 * ''f'' has zero mean.

 * ''f'' is isotropic: there is no preferential direction when
 viewing the function.
 
 * ''f'' looks random.
