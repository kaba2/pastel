Sparsity measures
=================

Given a set of vectors in a finite dimensional vector space, _sparsity_ 
is the property of there existing a basis in which most of the length 
of the vectors are contributed by only a few coefficients. 

Theory
------

Sparsity is quite general an idea, and can be made more concrete by 
defining specific sparsity measures. As an example, natural images 
and sounds often exhibit high sparsity, which is taken advantage of 
in compression. In particular, the [discrete cosine transform][Dct] 
is well-known for its ability to transform blocks of natural images 
to sparse representations.

In Pastel, a _sparsity measure_ is a function ''S: RR^n to [0, 1] sub RR'' 
which satisfies that:

* ''S'' is continuous in ''RR^n setminus {0}''.
* If all the coordinates of a vector are equal and non-zero, then ''S'' 
reaches its minimum and equals 0.
* If only one coordinate of a vector is non-zero, then ''S'' reaches its
maximum and equals 1.
* ''S'' is invariant to the scaling of a vector by a _non-zero_ scalar.
* ''S'' is invariant to the permutation of vector coordinates.
* ''S(0) = 1''

### p-sparsity measure

We shall define the _p-sparsity_ measure, ''p >= 1'', by

''S_p(x) = (1 / C_p) ([(1 / (n - 1)) sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i - m|^p] / 
    [(1 / n) sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i|^p]))^(1 / p),''

where

''m = (1 / n) sum_{i = 1}^n x_i''

and

''C_p = (((n - 1)^(p - 1) + 1) / (n^(p - 1)))^(1 / p)''

In particular, ''C_1 = 2'', and ''C_2 = 1''.
