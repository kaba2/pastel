General principles
==================

[[Parent]]: techniques.txt

This section contains some general principles which Pastel follows.

Algorithms
----------

Every algorithm in Pastel

* is [const-correct][Layered],
* is [exception-safe][Layered],
* follows the [principle of minimal requirements and maximal information][Layered],
* is documented for exception-safety,
* is documented for time-complexity, 
* is documented for space-complexity, and
* is [almost continuous][Continuity].

[Continuity]: [[Ref]]: algorithmic_continuity.txt

Data structures
---------------

Every data structure in Pastel

* follows the [open-closed principle][Layered],
* follows the [zero overhead principle][ClassWrapping],
* uses [settings types][Settings],
* uses [enhanced iterators][Enhanced],
* uses [adaptable iterators][Adaptable], and
* is [customizable][Customization],
