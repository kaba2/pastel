Uniform distortion
==================

[[Parent]]: pastelmath.txt

A _uniform distortion_ is a continuous function which distorts 
''[0, 1]^n sub RR^n'' to another point-set ''V sub RR^n'' such that 
if there is a uniform distribution on ''[0, 1]^n'' then the function 
maps it to a uniform distribution on ''V'' .

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the following distortions between
regions of uniform distributions:

 * ''[0, 1]^n harr'' simplex in ''RR^n''
 * ''[0, 1]^{n - 1} harr'' sphere (surface) in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 * ''[0, 1]^n harr'' ball in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 * ''[0, 1]^n harr'' annulus in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 * ''[0, 1]^{n - 1} harr'' hemisphere (surface) in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 
Although not actually a distortion to a uniform
sampling (we didn't have a better place for the
function), we also provide:

 * ''[0, 1]^{n - 1} harr'' cosine-weighted distribution on hemisphere (surface) in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''

This kind of uniform distribution distortion does not 
generalize easily to higher dimensions. To the best of 
our knowledge, none of the distortions listed above 
(except the simplex) have closed form solutions for n > 3.

If you simply need to generate random samples uniformly from ''V'',
then that is easier and can be done more generally using [uniform sampling][Sampling].
