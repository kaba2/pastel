A _matrix-norm_ is a vector-space-norm with two additional requirements:

	|AB| <= |A||B|, "and"
	|A| = |A*|.

A vector-norm ''|x|'' _induces_ a matrix-norm by: 

	|A| = max{|Ax|/|x| : x != 0}.
 
An induced matrix-norm is by definition _consistent_ with its
inducing vector-norm

	forall x: |Ax| <= |A||x|.

Not all matrix-norms are induced by a vector-norm.
