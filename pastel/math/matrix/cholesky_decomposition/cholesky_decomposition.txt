Cholesky decomposition
======================

[[Parent]]: matrix_decompositions.txt

The _Cholesky decomposition_ of a matrix ''A in RR^{m x m}'' is
a factorization ''A = LL^T'', where ''L in RR^{m x m}'' is
lower triangular. The Cholesky decomposition exists if and only
if ''A'' is symmetric and positive-definite.
