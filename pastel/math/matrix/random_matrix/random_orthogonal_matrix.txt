This section considers the generation of uniform random matrices
''Q in RR^{n xx n}'' such that ''Q^T Q = I'' and ''det(Q) = +- 1''. 
In other words, we would like to generate a random matrix ''Q in O(n)'', 
such that the distribution of ''Q'' is given by the Haar measure ''P'':

	forall Gamma, Q in O(n): P(Q in A) = P(Q in Gamma A),

for all measurable ''A subset O(n)''.

QR decomposition
----------------

The QR-decomposition is not unique. If 

	M = QR

is a QR-decomposition, then also

	M = (Q D) (D^-1 R)

is a QR-decomposition when ''D'' is a diagonal orthogonal matrix 
(diagonal consists of ''+-1''). To make the QR-decomposition unique, 
the signs of the diagonal of ''R'' must be fixed. For example,
to make the diagonal of ''R'' positive, ''D'' is chosen as

	D = diag(sign(diag(R))).

If ''M in RR^{n xx n}'' is generated from i.i.d. standard-normal real 
random variables, then ''QD'' is distributed with the Haar measure in 
''O(n)''.
