QR decomposition
================

[[Parent]]: matrix_decompositions.txt

The _QR-decomposition_ of a matrix ''A in RR^{m xx n}'' is
a factorization ''A = QR'', where ''Q in RR^{m xx m}'' is an orthogonal 
matrix, and ''R in RR^{m xx n}'' is an upper-triangular matrix. 
The QR-decomposition exists always.
