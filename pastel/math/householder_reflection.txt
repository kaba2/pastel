A _Householder reflection_ is an orthogonal, involutary matrix
(i.e. a reflection), which is specified by the normal of the
hyperplane w.r.t which the space is orthogonally reflected.

Definition
----------

A Householder reflection ''Q in RR^{n xx n}'' w.r.t. 
''v in RR^{1 xx n}'' is defined by
		
	Q = I - 2(v v^T) / (v^T v).

Properties
----------

A Householder reflection ''Q'' is an orthogonal reflection 
of a vector w.r.t. the hyperplane whose normal is ''v'':

	Qx = (I - 2(v v^T) / (v^T v))x
	= x - 2v (v^T x) / (v^T v)
	= x - 2 v' (:v', x:),

where

	v' = v / |v|.

''Q'' is symmetric:

	Q^T = (I - 2(v v^T) / (v^T v))^T
	= I - 2(v v^T) / (v^T v)
	= Q.
		
''Q'' is orthogonal and involutary:

	Q^T Q = Q^2
	= (I - 2(v v^T) / (v^T v))^2
	= I - 4(v v^T) / (v^T v) + (4v v^T v v^T) / (v^T v)^2
	= I - 4(v v^T) / (v^T v) + (4v(v^T v)v^T) / (v^T v)^2
	= I - 4(v v^T) / (v^T v) + 4(v v^T) / (v^T v)
	= I.

The orthogonality of ''Q'' implies that it preserves the 2-norm.

Matrix decompositions
---------------------

The Householder reflections are used for factoring orthogonal matrices
out of a general matrix ''A in RR^{m xx n}''. The QR-decomposition,
for example, can be computed by repeated use of Householder reflections.

A commonly reoccuring case is the following. Given a matrix ''A'', we would 
like to factor ''A = Q^T Q A'', where ''Q'' is a Householder reflection 
which sends the span of ''A( :, 1) = x in RR^m'' to the span of ''y in RR^m''. 
For brevity, let us assume ''v^T v = 1''. Since ''Q'' preserves 2-norms, 
we know that the ''v'' must also satisfy

	(I - 2v v^T)x = +- (|x|/|y|) y
	<=> x - 2v v^T x = +- (|x|/|y|) y
	<=> x +- (|x|/|y|) y = 2v v^T x
	<=> v = [x +- (|x|/|y|) y] / (2 v^T x).
	
Therefore, ''v'' is of the form

	v = u / |u|,
	
where

	u = x +- (|x|/|y|) y.

This gives two choices for the reflection normal ''v''. While both of them
do the specified job, one of the choices is better than the other from the
numerical viewpoint, because it avoids cancellation. This choice is
given by

	u = x + sgn((:x, y:)) (|x|/|y|) y.

Multiplying with the Householder reflection from the right can be used to
transform the rows of ''A'', instead of columns.

### QR decomposition
	
As an example of the use of the Householder reflection, we shall now consider the
QR decomposition. Given a matrix ''A in RR^{m xx n}'', let its first column 
be ''x in RR^m''. Form a Householder reflection ''Q_1'' such that the span of ''x''
is mapped to the span of ''e_1'' (the i:th standard basis vector). Then 

	Q_1^T Q_1 A = A, 
	
and ''Q_1 A'' has as its first column ''sgn(x_1) |x| e_1''. Now 
recurse to consider the submatrix of ''Q_1 A'' which is obtained by removing
the first row and the first column. Apply a Householder reflection ''Q_2^b in RR^{(m-1) xx (m-1)}'' to 
again map the first column of the submatrix to the first standard basis vector.
Finally, extend ''Q_2^b'' to a full block-diagonal matrix ''Q_2 in RR^{m xx m}'' 
where the upper-left block is an identity matrix. By repeating this procedure,
one obtains the factorization ''Q_1^T ... Q_n^T Q_n ... Q_1 A = A''. Denoting

	Q = Q_1^T ... Q_n^T, and
	R = Q_n ... Q_1 A

yields the QR-decomposition. 

### Bidiagonal decomposition

Very similarly to the QR-decomposition, one can factor any matrix ''A''
into a bidiagonal matrix surrounded by sequences of Householder reflections
from both sides. This decomposition is used as an initial stage of computing
the singular value decomposition.
