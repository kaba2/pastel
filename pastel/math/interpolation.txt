Curve interpolation
===================

Theory

Let ''M'' be a metric space. Let ''f : S sub RR -> M'' such that ''f'' is continuous. Then ''f[S]'' is
a _curve_ in ''M''. Let ''X'' be a finite subset of ''RR xx M''. ''f'' is said to _interpolate
''X''_ if 

''\forall (t, v) in X: f(t) = v''.

In general, the problem of curve interpolation fixes a function class C for the
curves and then asks for an algorithm that for a given set ''X'' returns an 
interpolating function from C. In case ''X'' does not uniquely determine a
function, additional conditions might be imposed for the solution.
