A smoothstep is a smooth increasing function f : R -> R such that 
f(x) = 0 for x <= 0, f(x) = 1 for x >= 1.

Theory
------

Let V be a metric space. Let f : R -> V, and f be continuous. Then f traces a
curve in V. Let X be a finite subset of R x V. f is said to interpolate
X if for all (t, v) in X it holds that f(t) = v.

In general, the problem of curve interpolation fixes a function class C for the
curves and then asks for an algorithm that for a given set X returns an 
interpolating function from C. In case X does not uniquely determine a
function, additional conditions might be imposed for the solution.
