Curve interpolation
===================

[[Parent]]: pastelmath.txt

A _curve_ is a continuous function from a subset of ''RR'' to a metric 
space ''M''. If the image of the function intersects with some finite 
set of points ''X sub M'', then the curve is said to _interpolate_ ''X''.

Theory
------

In general, the problem of curve interpolation fixes a function class ''C'' for the
curves and then asks for an algorithm that for a given set ''X'' returns an 
interpolating function from C. In case ''X'' does not uniquely determine a
function, additional conditions might be imposed for the solution.
