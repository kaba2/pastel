Linear algebra
==============

Theory
------

Every finite n-dimensional vector space over the reals is isomorphic to R^n.
Thus to solve problems in all such spaces, one only needs to develop
computational tools to handle problems in R^n. 
For brevity, let us abbreviate a finite m-dimensional vector space over
the real numbers simply as an m-vector space. For general n-vector spaces, 
the problem is first mapped to R^n (by choosing a suitable basis), 
solved there, and then mapped back to the original domain. 

Of special interest are linear functions between an n-vector space V 
and an m-vector space W. A linear function is simply a function from 
V to W which preserves linear combinations of vectors.
Choosing a basis in V can be used to fix an isomorphism between 
vectors of V and vectors of R^n. Similarly between W and R^m.
However, having fixed both isomorphism we have come to fix
an isomorphism between linear functions from V to W and
R^(m x n) matrices.

Matrix algebra is linear algebra in (in our case) R^n. 
Because of the isomorphism results, it is a machinery sufficiently powerful 
to answer questions in the theory of linear functions over 
finite dimensional vector spaces. Generalizing, one can allow arbitrary fields
to be used instead of the field of real numbers. Useful alternative 
fields include finite fields, complex numbers, and rational numbers.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements a matrix algebra component where matrices assume
elements from an ordered field. Most importantly, this abstraction 
includes real numbers (modeled with floating point numbers), and rational numbers 
(modeled as a ratio of two integers, allowing exact arithmetic).
For geometric problems and computer graphics, this covers most of the needs.
