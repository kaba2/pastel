Distortion of a uniform distribution to another one
===================================================

[Parent]: pastelmath.txt

Theory
------

A _uniform distortion_ is a continuous function that distorts ''[0, 1]^n sub RR^n'' 
to another point-set ''V sub RR^n'' such that if there 
is a uniform distribution on ''[0, 1]^n'' then the function maps
it to a uniform distribution on ''V'' .
If you simply need to generate random samples uniformly from ''V'',
then this easier and can be done more generally. See the links
below for more information on this.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the following distortions between
regions of uniform distributions:

 * ''[0, 1]^n harr'' simplex in ''RR^n''
 * ''[0, 1]^{n - 1} harr'' sphere (surface) in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 * ''[0, 1]^n harr'' ball in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 * ''[0, 1]^n harr'' annulus in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 * ''[0, 1]^{n - 1} harr'' hemisphere (surface) in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''
 
Although not actually a distortion to a uniform
sampling (we didn't have a better place for the
function), we also provide:

 * ''[0, 1]^{n - 1} harr'' cosine-weighted distribution on hemisphere (surface) in ''RR^1'', ''RR^2'', and ''RR^3''

This kind of uniform distribution distortion does not 
generalize easily to higher dimensions. To the best of 
our knowledge, none of the distortions listed above 
(except the simplex) have closed form solutions for n > 3.
The situation is different if you simply need to
generate a uniformly distributed sample rather than distort an
existing distribution. In this case the generalization
exists for all listed cases. See the link below for more
information.
