Affine transformations
======================

Theory
------

Let V and W be vector spaces over the reals. Let f : V -> W.
f is called _affine_ if it holds that

for all x, y in V: for all t in R:  
f((1 - t) x + t y) = (1 - t) f(x) + t f(y)

When V and W are finite dimensional, say of dimensions 
n and m respectively, we can identify them with R^n 
and R^m by choosing a basis in each. A linear transformation 
between R^n and R^m can be described with an R^(m x n) matrix. 
Similarly, it is easy to prove that an affine transformation 
can be described with functions of the form f(x) = Ax + b, 
where A is an R^(m x n) matrix, and b is a vector in R^m.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the AffineTransformation class to model
affine transformations in R^n as well as functions for
forming common affine transformations from various inputs, and
inverting a transformation.

An AffineTransformation acts on Vector's, Point's, and 
AffineTransformation's by an overloaded multiplication operator.
The effect of the transformation is different for each
type. For example, vectors are not affected by translation
part of an affine transformation.
