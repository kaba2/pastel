Affine transformations
======================

[Parent]: transformations.txt

Theory
------

Let ''V'' and ''W'' be vector spaces over the reals. Let ''f : V -> W''.
''f'' is called _affine_ if it holds that

''\forall x, y in V: \forall t in R:  f((1 - t) x + t y) = (1 - t) f(x) + t f(y)''

When ''V'' and ''W'' are finite dimensional, say of dimensions 
''n'' and ''m'' respectively, we can identify them with ''RR^n''
and ''RR^m'' by choosing a basis in each. A linear transformation 
between ''RR^n'' and ''RR^m'' can be described with an ''RR^{m xx n}'' matrix. 
Similarly, it is easy to prove that an _affine transformation_
can be described with functions of the form ''f(x) = Ax + b'', 
where ''A'' is an ''RR^{m xx n}'' matrix, and ''b'' is a vector in ''RR^m''.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the AffineTransformation class to model
affine transformations in ''RR^n'' as well as functions for
forming common affine transformations from various inputs, and
inverting a transformation.
