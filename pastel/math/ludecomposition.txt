PLU decomposition
=================

[Parent]: matrix_decompositions.txt

Theory
------

An arbitrary ''m xx n'' matrix ''A'' can be decomposed into

''A = PLU''

where

 * P is an ''m xx m'' permutation matrix.

 * L is an ''m xx m'' unit lower triangular matrix (has 1's on the diagonal).

 * U is an ''m xx n'' upper triangular matrix.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements an algorithm to compute the PLU
decomposition of a square matrix (if it exists)
The decomposition is encapsulated into a class because 
the decomposition results are tightly connected to each others.

Applications
------------

Consider solving a linear system

''Ax = b''
	
Where ''A'' is invertible and has a PLU decomposition.
The problem can be solved in ''O(n^3)'' operations using gaussian
elimination and back substitution (let us exclude
the faster algorithms). This is ok if the matrix
''A'' is involved only once in such an equation. However,
if ''b'' is varied and ''A'' stays constant, then there
is a much faster ways to solve the problems.
One can decompose ''A = PLU'', taking ''O(n^3)'' time. However,
after the decomposition has been computed, solutions to varying ''b''s
can be obtained in ''O(n^2)'' time. 

If ''A'' is also positive definite, the linear system can be
solved even faster, although only by a factor,
by the Cholesky decomposition.

Storage convention
------------------

Because ''L'' contains 1's on the diagonal, one can pack
''L'' and ''U'' to the same packed matrix ''E'' by throwing the 
diagonal of ''L'' out:

''E = (L - I) + U''

This packing scheme saves memory. The packed matrix
is what the decomposition object computes.
This packed matrix can be used in solving linear
equations by using the functions 'solveUpperTriangular'
and 'solveUnitLowerTriangular'. However, to make this even
easier, Pastel provides an overload for 'solveLinear'
which takes an LuDecomposition object instead of
a matrix.
