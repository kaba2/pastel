Theory
------

Let V be a subset of R^n. Strictly speaking, uniform sampling of V
means to generate random samples from V such that
the distribution of the random samples is uniform on V.
See the link at 'See also' at the bottom for more information.
Here our goal is to distort (in a continuous manner) 
an existing uniform distribution on a cube to a uniform 
distribution on some other kind of object.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the following distortions between
regions of uniform distributions:

 * [0, 1]^n <-> simplex in R^n
 * [0, 1]^(n - 1) <-> sphere (surface) in R^1, R^2, and R^3
 * [0, 1]^n <-> ball in R^1, R^2, and R^3
 * [0, 1]^n <-> annulus in R^1, R^2, and R^3
 * [0, 1]^(n - 1) <-> hemisphere (surface) in R^1, R^2, and R^3
 
Although not actually a distortion to a uniform
sampling (we didn't have a better place for the
function), we also provide:

 * [0, 1]^(n - 1) <-> cosine-weighted distribution on hemisphere (surface) in R^1, R^2, and R^3

This kind of uniform distribution distortion does not 
generalize easily to higher dimensions. To the best of 
our knowledge, none of the distortions listed above 
(except the simplex) have closed form solutions for n > 3.
The situation is different if you simply need to
generate a uniformly distributed sample rather than distort an
existing distribution. In this case the generalization
exists for all listed cases. See the link at 'See also' 
at the bottom for more information.
