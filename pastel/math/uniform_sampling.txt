Uniform sampling

Theory
------

_Uniform sampling of ''V sub RR^n''_ is the problem of generating random 
samples from ''V'' with a uniform distribution. 

Practice
--------

In the following we assume that we are able to uniformly
sample a real interval. A general algorithm to uniformly 
sample any set ''V'' is to bound it with an axis-aligned box ''B'',
draw samples from a uniform distribution on ''B'',
and accept only those samples which are also
in ''V''. This is called _rejection sampling_. The
probability that a sample drawn from ''B'' is also
in ''V'' is the ratio of the measures of ''V'' and ''B''.
Thus the efficiency is highly dependent on this
ratio. Unfortunately, this ratio is often low,
or even zero. For example, uniformly sampling
the surface of a sphere in ''RR^3'' would not succeed
using rejection sampling in the described manner.

Thus, more than often it is either necessary,
or much more efficient, to generate uniform
samplings via slightly more complex algorithms.
Pastel implements efficient algorithms to
uniform sample from:

 * a box in ''RR^n''
 * a sphere (surface) in ''RR^n''
 * a ball in ''RR^n''
 * an annulus in ''RR^n''

If instead you need to distort an existing uniform sampling
from one shape to another, see the link below.
