This section considers the generation of a uniform random matrix 
''Q in RR^{n xx n}'' such that ''Q^T Q = I'' (then ''det(Q) = +- 1''). 
In other words, of generating a random matrix ''Q in O(n)'', the 
orthogonal group, such that the resulting distribution has the Haar 
measure (the measures of subsets of ''O(n)'' are invariant to orthogonal 
transformations):

	forall A sub O(n): forall Gamma in O(n): P(Q in A) = P(Q in Gamma A).

QR decomposition
----------------

The QR-decomposition is not unique. If 

	M = QR

is a QR-decomposition, then also

	M = (Q D) (D^-1 R)

is a QR-decomposition when ''D'' is a diagonal orthogonal matrix 
(diagonal consist of +-1). To make the QR-decomposition unique, 
the signs of the diagonal of ''R'' must be fixed. For example,
to make the diagonal of ''R'' positive, ''D'' is chosen as

	D = diag(sign(diag(R))).

If ''M in RR^{n xx n}'' is generated from i.i.d. standard-normal real 
random variables, then ''QD'' is distributed with the Haar measure in 
''O(n)''.
