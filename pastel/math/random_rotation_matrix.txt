==============================

This section considers the generation of uniform random matrices 
''Q in RR^{n xx n}'' such that ''Q^T Q = I'' and ''det(Q) = 1''. 
In other words, we would like to generate a random matrix ''Q in SO(n)'' 
such that the distribution of ''Q'' is given by the Haar measure ''P'':

	forall Gamma, Q in SO(n): P(Q in A) = P(Q in Gamma A),

for all measurable ''A subset SO(n)''.

Rejection sampling
------------------

Let ''Q'' be a [uniform random orthogonal matrix][RandomOrthogonal].
Since ''Q'' is uniformly distributed in ''O(n)'', it will have
''det(Q) = -1'' with probability 0.5. Thus, one way to generate
rotation matrices with uniform distribution is to reject 
random orthogonal matrices until ''det(Q) = 1''.

Reflection
----------

Let ''Q'' be uniform random orthogonal matrix. If ''det(Q) = -1'', one 
can get a ''Q'' with ''det(Q) = 1'' by negating the first column of ''Q''. 
This seems to produce the same result as rejection sampling (when plotting 
the density of eigenvalues). However, I am lacking a proof for this. 
This is the current implementation.
