Uniform random rotation matrix
==============================

[[Parent]]: random_matrix.txt

This section describes the generation of uniform random rotation
matrices.

Rejection sampling
------------------

Let ''Q'' be a [[Link: random_orthogonal_matrix.txt]].
Since ''Q'' is uniformly distributed in ''O(n)'', it will have
''det(Q) = -1'' with probability 0.5. Thus, one way to generate
rotation matrices with uniform distribution is to reject 
random orthogonal matrices until ''det(Q) = 1''.

Reflection
----------

If ''det(Q) = -1'', one can get a ''Q'' with ''det(Q) = 1'' by negating 
the first column of ''Q''. This seems to produce the same result as 
rejection sampling (when plotting the density of eigenvalues). However, 
I am lacking a proof for this. This is the current implementation.
