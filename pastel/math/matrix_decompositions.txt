Matrix decompositions
=====================

Theory
------

Matrix decompositions factorize a matrix into a product of 
several matrices. While important theoretically when
deriving results, they are also important from the
computational point of view. 

Practice
--------

Pastel implements the PLU, QR, Cholesky,
and singular value decompositions.

Other decompositions
--------------------

Eigendecomposition is a commonly needed matrix decomposition.
However, it is tricky to implement from the numerical point of view 
and many books thus warn against implementing your own versions for serious
use because of the plethora of possible pitfalls.
The same arguments also goes for the SVD.
We take this advice in two forms. First, we simply copy the
code for SVD from the book "Numerical Recipes" and trust
the authors in its robustness. Second, we do not implement eigendecomposition 
at all. Fortunately, eigendecomposition is needed quite
rarely in computer graphics and geometry compared to the 
other four decompositions.
