Internal dependencies
=====================

[Parent]: pastel.txt

The dependencies between Pastel's sub-libraries 
form an acyclic directed graph. Because of this,
Pastel can be used either in its entirety
or only as a subset if some functionality is not required.
The following (transitively reduced) graph summarizes the 
internal dependencies.
