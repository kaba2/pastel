The _discrete fourier transform_ (DFT) is an invertible linear 
mapping ''DFT : CC^N -> CC^N'' defined by:

''DFT(x) = M x'',
where
''M in CC^{N \times N}, M_{kn} = e^{-i pi k n / N}.''

It can be viewed as a change of basis from the standard orthogonal basis to a 
complex exponential basis. This mapping can be made orthogonal by
multiplying the resulting vector with ''1 / sqrt(N)''. Such a transformation 
has the convenient property of preserving 2-norms.

The DFT is interesting because, in this new basis, the coefficients correspond to
the weights of sinusoids at different frequencies. Thus, effectively the DFT
decomposes the vector components into a linear combination of sinusoids, with the 
weights given by the coefficients. This in turn allows for a powerful way to modify
signals by attenuating or amplifying the desired sinusoids.

The DFT generalizes easily to a multi-dimensional setting. Here the vectors are
multi-dimensional arrays, and the exponential basis functions are radially extended
from the 1-dimensional case. This transformation is separable: it can be computed
by performing 1-dimensional DFT:s for each column in each dimension successively.
For example, a 2-dimensional DFT is performed by doing 1-dimensional DFTs first on
rows, and then on columns (or the other way around).
