Signal transforms
=================

This section provides efficient implementations of specific kinds of 
linear transformations from ''RR^n'' to ''RR^n'', and from ''CC^n'' to
''CC^n''. These include the discrete cosine transform (DCT), the discrete 
wavelet transform (DWT), and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Whereas 
an arbitrary linear transformation can be applied by a matrix-vector 
multiplication in time ''O(n^2)'', these transformations can be applied 
in time ''O(n log(n))'', or even in time ''O(n)''. Furthermore, no space is 
needed to represent the transformation matrix. This efficiency is 
achieved by exploiting the additional mathematical structure available 
in these transforms.
