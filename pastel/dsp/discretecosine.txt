The _discrete cosine transform_ (DCT) is an invertible linear 
mapping ''DCT : CC^N -> CC^N'' defined by:

''DCT(x) = M x'',
where
''M in CC^{N \times N}, M_{kn} = cos(pi (k / N) (n + 1 / 2)).''

It can be viewed as a change of basis from the standard basis to a cosine basis. 
This mapping can be made orthogonal by multiplying the first row of ''M''
by ''sqrt(1 / N)'', and the rest of ''M'' by ''sqrt(2 / N)''. Such a transformation 
has the convenient property of preserving 2-norms.

The DCT is interesting for the same reasons as the [discrete fourier transform][DFT].
However, particularly when applied to images, the DCT has a strong _energy compaction
property_, which means that most of the information (length) of a vector is contained
in the first few coefficients. This property has been extensively taken advantage of 
in image compression.
