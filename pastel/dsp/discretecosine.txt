Theory
------

The _discrete cosine transform_ (DCT) is an invertible linear 
mapping ''DCT : CC^N -> CC^N'' defined by:

''DCT(x) = M x'', where

''M in CC^{N \times N}, M_{kn} = cos(pi (k / N) (n + 1 / 2)).''

Its inverse is given by:

''IDCT(x) = M^{-1} x'', where

''M^{-1} in CC^{N \times N}, M_{kn}^{-1} = ...''

The _unitary discrete cosine transform_ is given by multiplying the first row of ''M''
by ''sqrt(1 / N)'', and the rest of ''M'' by ''sqrt(2 / N)''. Such a transformation 
has the convenient property of preserving 2-norms.
The DCT can be viewed as a change of basis from the standard basis to a cosine basis. 

### Real vs complex

Since the matrix ''M'' is real, the DCT and IDCT are closed under ''RR^n''.
Using the DCT on real vectors is arguably the most common use-case. In this real 
case the unitary version is called an _orthogonal discrete cosine transform_.

### Applications

The DCT is interesting for the same reasons as the [discrete fourier transform][DFT].
However, especially when applied to images, the DCT has a strong _energy compaction
property_, which means that most of the information (length) of a vector is contained
in the first few coefficients. This property has been extensively taken advantage of 
in image compression.

Practice
--------

Pastel implements efficient ''O(n log n)'' algorithms for computing the DCT and 
the IDCT, when ''n'' is a power of two. Both the standard and the orthogonal version
are provided, as well as both real and complex versions.
