My educational points
=====================

[Back to Pastel](./pastel.htm)

There are some educational points that I would like to
transmit with the publishing of the Pastel library.
Here they are:

 * Geometric problems are best solved using coordinate-free
 derivations, i.e. in arbitrary dimensions. Given
 one succeeds in deriving the results, it means
 that the solution is essentially the same for all
 dimensions. Using coordinate-free techniques you
 implement an algorithm only once, saving you from
 synchronizing versions for different dimensions.
 Coordinate-free code is also highly intuitive and
 readable.

 * A programmer should write code to be read by others.
 This means two things. Foremost, it means that the 
 abstraction level must be raised to the point that it 
 coincides with the mental concepts used by the people in a 
 given field. But almost as importantly, it means that
 the style and naming must be such that the code is easy 
 to read.
