Description
-----------

Pastel is a C++ library for geometry and computer graphics.

Publishing
----------

The motivation for publishing Pastel is two-fold. First,
I hope it to transmit some useful implementation
experience, techniques, and documentation for the people 
interested in computer graphics, geometry, and programming. 
Second, I have implemented another library ([TIM][]) that uses 
Pastel, and I want to be open with sources.

Source code
-----------

The source-code for Pastel is licensed under the GNU Lesser GPL license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. There are two easy ways to browse the source-code
online complete with coloring. The first one is to read this documentation, 
following the _Learn more_ links. The second one is to view the 
source-code tree.

 * [View the source-code tree][ViewSourceTree].
 * [Download the source-code][DownloadSource].

Pastel has several dependencies to third-party libraries which must also be
installed if you want to build Pastel yourself. See the _Installation_ link
below for more information.

Technical features
------------------

 * Standard C++03
 * Cross-platform (in particular, Windows and Linux)
 * Compiler independent
 * Processor independent
 * Endianness independent
 * Exception-safe
 * Type-safe
 * Const-correct
 * Style-consistent
 * Thread-safe (re-entrant)

Sub-libraries
------------

Pastel divides into a number of sub-libraries. These are:

 * [PastelSys][], for core functionality
 * [PastelMath][], for mathematics in general
 * [PastelGeometry][], for geometric problems
 * [PastelDsp][], for signal processing
 * [PastelGfx][], for computer graphics
 * [PastelDevice][], for access to hardware
 * [PastelGl][], for OpenGl-related stuff
 * (PastelRay, for photorealistic 3d rendering, not published yet)

The dependencies between the sub-libraries form a directed acyclic graph. This means
that it is possible to exclude those sub-libraries that aren't needed.
