Description
-----------

Pastel is a C++ library for geometry and computer graphics.

Publishing
----------

The motivation for publishing Pastel is two-fold. First,
I hope it to transmit some useful implementation
experience, techniques, and documentation for people 
interested in computer graphics, geometry, and programming. 
Second, I have implemented another library ([TIM][]) that uses 
Pastel, and I want to be open with sources.

Source code
-----------

The source-code for Pastel is licensed under the GNU Lesser GPL license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. While this allows you to build your programs using
Pastel, I do not recommend you do this. This is because I am still developing 
the library and can in this process break backwards-compatibility. 

There are two easy ways to browse the source-code
online complete with coloring. The first one is to read this documentation, 
following the links. The second one is to view the 
source-code tree.

Pastel has several dependencies to third-party libraries which must also be
installed if you want to build Pastel yourself. See the _External dependencies_ 
link below for more information.
