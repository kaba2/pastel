Pastel
======

Description
-----------

Pastel is a C++ library for geometry and computer graphics.

Philosophy
----------

Design, clarity, and documentation are the primary goal. Write programs
and documentation to be read by others. Take asymptotic complexities of 
algorithms and other obvious by-a-factor optimizations as
part of the design requirements. Only implement what you need. 
Optimize only if need for such is recognized by profiling.

Technical features
------------------

 * Standard C++03
 * Cross-platform (in particular, Windows and Linux)
 * Compiler independent
 * Processor independent
 * Endianness independent
 * Exception-safe
 * Type-safe
 * Const-correct
 * Style-consistent
 * Thread-safe (re-entrant)
 * Generic

Publishing
----------

The motivation for publishing Pastel is two-fold. First,
I hope the library to transmit some educational points
for people interested in computer graphics, geometry, 
and programming. You can read about what they are by 
following the proper link in 'Learn more'.
Second, I have implemented another library that uses Pastel. 
Because I want to be open with the source, this is a 
good time to publish Pastel too.

Pastel is licensed under the GNU LGPL. While
this allows you to integrate it with your own projects, 
I don't recommend you to do so. This is because I can't guarantee
stable interfaces. I'll be improving the library,
and sometimes this means breaking backward compatibility.

Sub-libraries
------------

Pastel divides into a number of sub-libraries. These are:

 * [PastelSys][], for core functionality
 * [PastelMath][], for math primitives
 * [PastelGeometry][], for geometric problems
 * [PastelDsp][], for signal processing tasks
 * [PastelGfx][], for 2d graphics tasks
 * [PastelDevice][], for access to hardware
 * [PastelGl][], for OpenGl related stuff
 * (PastelRay, for photorealistic 3d rendering, not published)

The dependencies between the sub-libraries form a directed acyclic graph. This means
that it is possible to exclude those sub-libraries that aren't needed.
