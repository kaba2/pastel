License
-------

Pastel is licensed under the [MIT license][MIT]. 

While this allows you to build your own programs using Pastel, 
I do not recommend you do this. This is because Pastel is still under 
development and is thus prone to break backwards-compatibility. Rather, 
consider it from an educational viewpoint containing implementations 
and documentations of useful data structures and algorithms.
