Purpose
-------

Pastel is a library for photorealistic computer graphics and geometric computations.

Philosophy
----------

Good design, clarity and documentation are the primary goal. 
Asymptotic complexities of algorithms and other obvious by-a-factor optimizations are 
considered part of the design requirements. Only implement what you need. 
Detailed optimization is only done if a need for such has been recognized by profiling.

Technical requirements
----------------------

 * Works on Windows and Linux
 * Compiler independent
 * Processor independent
 * Endianness independent
 * Exception-safe
 * Type-safe
 * Const-correct
 * Style-consistent
 * Generic
 * Thread-safe (re-entrant)

External libraries
------------------

Boost
Glew
SDL
Rply

What are the disabled Visual Studio warnings?
---------------------------------------------

4351
new behavior: elements of array 'array' will be default initialized

4996
'function': was declared deprecated

4251
'identifier' : class 'type' needs to have dll-interface to be used by clients of class 'type2'

4018
'expression' : signed/unsigned mismatch

4267
'var' : conversion from 'size_t' to 'type', possible loss of data

When compiling with /Wp64, or when compiling on a 64-bit operating system, type is 32 bits but size_t is 64 bits when compiling for 64-bit targets. 

4305 
'identifier' : truncation from 'type1' to 'type2'

The identifier is converted to a smaller type, resulting in loss of information.

4244
'argument' : conversion from 'type1' to 'type2', possible loss of data. 

A floating point type was converted to an integer type. A possible loss of data may have occurred.

4312
'operation' : conversion from 'type1' to 'type2' of greater size

This warning detects 64-bit portability issues. You attempted to assign a 32-bit value to a 64-bit type. For example, casting a 32-bit int or 32-bit long to a 64-bit pointer.

4224
nonstandard extension used : formal parameter 'identifier' was previously defined as a type

The identifier was previously used as a typedef. This causes a warning under ANSI compatibility (/Za).
