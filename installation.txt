-----------------------------

 * Add the 'PASTEL_ROOT/pastel' to the compiler's include search paths.
 This directory contains the source code for Pastel.

 * Add the 'PASTEL_ROOT/lib' directory to the compiler's 
library search paths. This directory will contain the generated
libraries.

 * Add the 'PASTEL_ROOT/lib' directory to the operating system's
