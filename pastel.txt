_Pastel_ is a cross-platform C++ / Matlab library for geometry and 
computer graphics.

Source code
-----------

The source code for TIM is hosted on [BitBucket][] in a [Mercurial][] 
repository. Assuming you have Mercurial installed, the repository can 
be cloned from the command-line by

	hg clone https://bitbucket.org/kaba2/pastel

The source code always reflects the current development; it is unstable. 
To obtain the source code corresponding to this version, write

[[+Verbatim]]:
	hg update -r 1.4.0

For previous versions, see the [release history][History]

License
-------

Pastel is licensed under the [MIT license][MIT]. 

While this allows you to build your own programs using Pastel, 
I do not recommend you do this. This is because Pastel is still under 
development and is thus prone to break backwards-compatibility. Rather, 
consider it from an educational viewpoint containing implementations 
and documentations of useful data structures and algorithms.
