Description
-----------

Pastel is a C++ library for geometry and computer graphics.

Documentation
-------------

Pastel uses a novel documentation system called _LightMark_ to
integrate source code with its documentation. Thus you will find that 
browsing the source code of Pastel is a bit different than what you might 
have used to. 

Rather than repeating what is said in the source-code as part 
of the interface documentation, the documentation in these pages
defines the theory behind the subjects, as well as gives a
high-level practical introduction to the subject. The source-code
files that are related to each subject are gathered as links
onto the documentation page of that subject. 
This approach is somewhat reminiscent of the literate programming paradigm 
where the source code is mixed with prose. However, instead of going
that far, LightMark obtains a tight coupling between the source
code and documentation by organizing all files into a hierarchical 
tree. This tree allows you to concentrate on the interesting part 
while ignoring the rest. 

If you are interested, you can find more information about the LightMark 
documentation system from below.

Source code
-----------

The source-code for Pastel is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_ license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. While this allows you to build your own programs using
Pastel, I do not recommend you do this. This is because Pastel is still under development
and is thus prone to break backwards-compatibility. Rather, consider it from 
an educational viewpoint containing implementations and documentations of useful 
data structures and algorithms.

Pastel has several dependencies to third-party libraries which must also be
installed if you want to build Pastel yourself. See the _External dependencies_ 
link below for more information.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions at all. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.
