Pastel

_Pastel_ is a cross-platform C++11 library for geometry and computer 
graphics.

Source code
-----------

Pastel is licensed under the MIT license, which is unrestrictive and 
non-viral. While this allows you to build your own programs using Pastel, 
I do not recommend you do this. This is because Pastel is still under 
development and is thus prone to break backwards-compatibility. Rather, 
consider it from an educational viewpoint containing implementations 
and documentations of useful data structures and algorithms.
