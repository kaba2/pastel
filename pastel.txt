Description
-----------

_Pastel_ is a C++ library for geometry and computer graphics.

Source code
-----------

Pastel is licensed under the _GNU Lesser GPL_ license, which is 
unrestrictive and non-viral. While this allows you to build your own programs using
Pastel, I do not recommend you do this. This is because Pastel is still under development
and is thus prone to break backwards-compatibility. Rather, consider it from 
an educational viewpoint containing implementations and documentations of useful 
data structures and algorithms.

Pastel has several dependencies to third-party libraries which must also be
installed if you want to build Pastel yourself. See the _External dependencies_ 
link below for more information.

Note on web-browsers
--------------------

This documentation uses MathML to display inlined mathematics.
Unfortunately not all browsers support MathML natively, including
Internet Explorer. In this case you will not be able to see the 
mathematical expressions at all. While there is a plug-in 
available (MathPlayer) for adding this capability to Internet Explorer, 
in our tests this combination crashed the browser when viewing 
these pages. According to Wikipedia, some major web-browsers that 
currently display MathML natively include Mozilla Firefox, Opera, 
and Camino. At this point we can't do anything else than to direct 
you to use these browsers to view these pages.
