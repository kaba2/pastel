External dependencies
=====================

Practice
--------

Pastel uses a few external third-party libraries which 
must be installed in order to compile and link all
Pastel libraries succesfully. The following list summarizes 
these dependencies:

 * Boost: All of Pastel
 * SDL: PastelDevice
 * Glew: PastelGl

After installing these libraries, make sure 
you add their corresponding directories for the 
include files (.h, .hpp, etc) and libraries (.lib, etc) 
to the search paths of your compiler. 

### Boost

<http://www.boost.org/>

Pastel refers to Boost's include files in the form
'#include \<boost/operators.hpp\>'.
Pastel only uses the template code found in Boost and
thus requires no linking with object code.
Boost is licensed under the Boost license.

### SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

<http://www.libsdl.org/>

Pastel refers to SDL's include files in the form 
'#include \<SDL.h\>'. 
In the included Visual Studio project files, the SDL library
is referred to as 'SDL.lib' (both in release and debug mode).
SDL is licensed under the GNU LGPL.

### Glew (Gl Extension Wrangler)

<http://glew.sourceforge.net/>

Pastel refers to Glew's include files in the form 
'#include \<GL/glew.h\>'. 
In the included Visual Studio project files, the Glew library
is referred to as 'glew32.lib' (both in release and debug mode).
Glew is licensed under a modified BSD license.

### Official Mersenne Twister source code

<http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html>

Pastel integrates a minimally modified version of the official
Mersenne Twister source code directly into the PastelSys library. 
No installation is needed.
