This page documents experiences with fighting some non-obvious bugs.
The hope is that the next time such a bug happens, it is already documented
here.

Invalid MEX-file 'somefile.mexw32': The specified module could not be found.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Description

I was trying to call a mex file from Matlab, but was stumped on the
given error message. However, I had just built the mex file, so the file
certainly was there.

### Cause

I had enabled OpenMp, but had not included 'omp.h'.

### Solution

I included 'omp.h' to proper places. I guess why this helps is that it 
also causes the OpenMp library to be linked in.
