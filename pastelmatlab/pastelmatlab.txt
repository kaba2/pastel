PastelMatlab
============

[[Parent]]: pastel.txt

_PastelMatlab_ provides tools for easier interfacing with Matlab, when 
creating mex files. It provides the mex entry point, convenience 
functions for retrieving Matlab arguments, and a way to register multiple 
functions to be callable via the entry point. It provides logging directly 
back to Matlab using the `mexPrintf` function. PastelMatlab also provides 
convenient reporting in case an invariant failure occurs.
