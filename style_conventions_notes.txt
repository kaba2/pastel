Style conventions notes
=======================

[[Parent]]: style_conventions.txt

This section contains additional notes on style conventions.

Rejected rules
--------------

For readability, the following have been explicitly rejected:

* Hungarian notation, encoding the type of the variable into the variable name. For example `iSize` for variable named `size` of int type.

* Using `get` prefix in getters. It is clearer to read `if (cow.weight() > 5)` than `if (cow.getWeight() > 5)`.

* Using `is` prefix in boolean getters (except for the exception). This prefix leads to long inflections. It is clearer to read `if (overlaps(sphere, alignedBox))` than `if (isOverlapping(sphere, alignedBox))`.

Deprecated rules
----------------

* Specify variables const as often as possible. This makes the code easier to read since the reader can fix the meaning and value of a variable in his head for the rest of the code. For example: `const integer index = i * 5 + 1;`. Exception: Do not specify function parameters given by value as const. This makes function declarations look odd and thus harder to read because it is unconventional. This rule was deprecated, because it may interfere with move-optimizations.
