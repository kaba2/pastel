Dependencies
============

[[Parent]]: pastel.txt

Here we summarize the dependencies inside Pastel, and 
Pastel's dependencies to external libraries.

Internal dependencies
---------------------

The dependencies between Pastel's sub-libraries 
form an acyclic directed graph. Because of this,
Pastel can be used either in its entirety
or only as a subset if some functionality is not required.
The following (transitively reduced) graph summarizes the 
internal dependencies.

External dependencies
---------------------

Pastel uses a few external libraries which must be installed in order 
to compile and link all Pastel libraries succesfully. These libraries 
are listed here.

### Boost

<http://www.boost.org/>

Pastel refers to Boost's include files in the form
`boost/operators.hpp`.
Pastel only uses the template code found in Boost and
thus requires no linking with object code.
Boost is licensed under the Boost license.

### SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

<http://www.libsdl.org/>

Pastel refers to SDL's include files in the form `SDL.h`. 
SDL is licensed under the GNU LGPL.

### Glew (Gl Extension Wrangler)

<http://glew.sourceforge.net/>

Pastel refers to Glew's include files in the form `GL/glew.h`. 
Glew is licensed under a modified BSD license.

### Official Mersenne Twister source code

<http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html>

Pastel integrates a minimally modified version of the official
Mersenne Twister source code directly into the PastelSys library. 
No installation is needed.
