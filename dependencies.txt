Dependencies
============

[[Parent]]: pastel.txt

In this section we summarize the dependencies inside Pastel and
Pastel's dependencies to external libraries.

Internal dependencies
---------------------

The dependencies between Pastel's sub-libraries 
form an acyclic directed graph. Because of this,
Pastel can be used either in its entirety
or only as a subset if some functionality is not required.
The following (transitively reduced) graph summarizes the 
internal dependencies, as well as external dependencies.

External dependencies
---------------------

Some, but not all, of the sub-libraries of Pastel are dependent
on external libraries which must be installed in order to compile 
and link them. These external libraries are listed here. The detailed 
dependency relations are visualized in the graph above. The version 
number that follows the library name is the one that the current 
version of Pastel was used to develop against. This is useful to know 
in case a later version breaks backward compatibility.

### Boost 1.51

<http://www.boost.org/>

Pastel refers to Boost's include files in the form
`boost/operators.hpp`.
Pastel only uses the template code found in Boost and
thus requires no linking with object code.
Boost is licensed under the Boost license.

### Official Mersenne Twister source code

<http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/emt19937ar.html>

Pastel integrates a minimally modified version of the official
Mersenne Twister source code directly into the PastelSys library. 
No installation is needed.

### Remark 1.5

<http://kaba.hilvi.org/remark>

The documentation for Pastel is written in Remark. This library is
not required to build Pastel.
