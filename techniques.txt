Recurring programming techniques in Pastel
==========================================

[[Parent]]: pastel.txt

Certain programming techniques are recurringly used in the 
implementation of Pastel. Those techniques are introduced here with 
the aim of being able to make more sense of the source code. The 
important technique of precondition checking is explained in the 
[testing section][Precondition]. The algorithm objects are explained
[here][Algorithm].
