Building the Pastel Matlab interface
====================================

[[Parent]]: building.txt

This section describes how to build the Pastel Matlab interface. 
Before doing this, you must first [build the Pastel library][Core].

[Core]: [[Ref]]: building.txt

Build process
-------------

Matlab uses special kinds of shared libraries to extend it. These
are called _mex files_. The building process for such files must be 
driven from Matlab, because this is the only way that the approriate
libraries will get linked into the resulting mex library, no matter
what the Matlab version. Matlab redirects the compilation and linking
to an external compiler, such as Visual Studio or gcc. 

### 1. Select a compiler

To select the compiler Matlab uses, type

	mex -setup
	
on the Matlab command line, and follow the instructions. 
A compiler can be used to build the Pastel Matlab 
interface if
 
 * The compiler is [supported by Matlab][MatlabSupported], meaning also 
   that the compiler has been used to build the Matlab external interface
   libraries (i.e. it is not ok to change the used gcc version 
   manually). The used C++ standard libraries must match across 
   all libraries.
 
 * The same compiler is used to build the Pastel libraries.
 
 * The architectures of the libraries match: 
 32-bit libraries against 32-bit libraries,
 and 64-bit libraries against 64-bit libraries.
 
__Note__: Matlab 32-bit is required to build 32-bit mex files, and
Matlab 64-bit is required to build 64-bit mex files. In particular, it 
is not possible to do 32-bit builds from Matlab 64-bit.

### 2. Set the external library directories

In `pastel/` directory, open the file `build_pastel.m`,
which will read something like this:

	% Change this to the boost include path.
	boostIncludePath = '../../boost_1_53_0';
	
Replace the directory to reflect the location of the Boost library.

### 3. Build

To build Pastel Matlab interface in release mode, 
type in Matlab command line:

	>> build_pastel

To build the Pastel Matlab interface in debug mode,
type in Matlab command line:

	>> build_pastel('mode', 'debug')

Output files
------------

The output will be a set of dynamic libraries (mex files), 
whose names without file-extensions are

 * `pastelsysmatlab`
 * `pastelmathmatlab`
 * `pastelgeometrymatlab`

The file-extension depends on the operating system,
and whether the Matlab that is being used to build the
mex file is 32-bit or 64-bit. The file-extensions are:

 * Mac (64-bit): `.mexmaci64`
 * Linux (64-bit): `.mexa64`
 * Linux (32-bit): `.mexglx`
 * Windows (64-bit): `.mexw64`
 * Windows (32-bit): `.mexw32`

Ideally, you would have all of these variations built, so 
that you have a version of Pastel Matlab which works in any
operating system, and whether Matlab is 32-bit or 64-bit.
The prebuilt Pastel Matlab is published this way.
