Building the Pastel Matlab interface
====================================

[[Parent]]: building.txt

This section describes how to build the Pastel Matlab interface. 
Before doing this, you must first [build the Pastel library][Core].

[Core]: [[Ref]]: building.txt

Build process
-------------

Matlab uses special kinds of shared libraries to extend it. These
are called _mex files_. The building process for such files must be 
driven from Matlab, because this is the only way that the approriate
libraries will get linked into the resulting mex library, no matter
what the Matlab version. Matlab redirects the compilation and linking
to an external compiler, such as Visual Studio or gcc. 

### 1. Select a compiler

To select the compiler Matlab uses, type

	mex -setup cpp
	
on the Matlab command line, and follow the instructions. A compiler can be used to build the Pastel Matlab interface if 

* The same compiler is used to build the Pastel libraries.
 
 * The architectures of the libraries match: 
 32-bit libraries against 32-bit libraries,
 and 64-bit libraries against 64-bit libraries.

#### Supported compilers

The list of compilers which work out-of-the-box in Matlab is given in [here][MatlabSupported]. However, it is not necessary for the compiler to be in this list; new compilers can unofficially be added into Matlab. This is useful, for example, when developing for a pre-release version of a new version of Visual Studio.

#### Bitness

Matlab 32-bit is required to build 32-bit mex files, and Matlab 64-bit is required to build 64-bit mex files. In particular, it is not possible to do 32-bit builds from Matlab 64-bit.

### 2. Build

To build Pastel Matlab interface in Release mode, set the folder to `bin/toolset/matlab`, and type in Matlab command line

	>> build_pastel

To build the Pastel Matlab interface in debug mode, set the folder to `bin/toolset/matlab`, and type in Matlab command line

	>> build_pastel('mode', 'debug')

For further options, type

	>> help build_pastel

#### Build script

The `build_pastel.m` file is automatically generated from the template [[Link: build_pastel.template.m]] when building Pastel, by substituting the correct build-information.

Output files
------------

The output will be a set of dynamic libraries (mex files), whose names without file-extensions are

 * `pastelsysmatlab`
 * `pastelmathmatlab`
 * `pastelgeometrymatlab`

The file-extension depends on the operating system, and whether the Matlab that is being used to build the mex file is 32-bit or 64-bit. The file-extensions are:

OS                | Bits | File extension
------------------|------|---------------
Mac               | 64   | `.mexmaci64`
Linux             | 64   | `.mexa64`
Linux             | 32   | `.mexglx`
Windows           | 64   | `.mexw64`
Windows           | 32   | `.mexw32`

Ideally, you would have all of these variations built, so that you have a version of Pastel Matlab which works in any operating system, and whether Matlab is 32-bit or 64-bit. The prebuilt Pastel Matlab is published this way.
