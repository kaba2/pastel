This section contains some general principles which Pastel follows.

Algorithms
----------

Every algorithm in Pastel

* is [const-correct][Layered],
* is [exception-safe][Layered],
* follows the [principle of minimal requirements and maximal information][Layered],
* is documented for exception-safety,
* is documented for time-complexity, and
* is documented for space-complexity.

Data structures
---------------

Every data structure in Pastel

* follows the [open-closed principle][Layered],
* follows the [zero overhead principle][ClassWrapping],
* uses [settings types][Settings],
* uses [adaptable iterators][Adaptable], and
* is [customizable][Customization],
